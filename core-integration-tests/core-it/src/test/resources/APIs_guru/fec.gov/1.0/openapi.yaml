    This application programming interface (API) allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns. 

     The Federal Election Commission (FEC) API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. 

     There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints. 

     <b class="body" id="getting_started_head">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br> 

     If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md). 

     Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to <a href="mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). 

     The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. 

     A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations. [Learn more here](https://www.fec.gov/updates/sale-or-use-contributor-information/).

      Candidate endpoints give you access to information about the people running for office. This information is organized by `candidate_id`. If you're unfamiliar with candidate IDs, using `/candidates/search/` will help you locate a particular candidate. 

       Officially, a candidate is an individual seeking nomination for election to a federal office. People become candidates when they (or agents working on their behalf) raise contributions or make expenditures that exceed $5,000. 

       The candidate endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration [Form 1](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm1.pdf) for committee information and [Form 2](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/fecfrm2.pdf) for candidate information.

      Committees are entities that spend and raise money in an election. Their characteristics and relationships with candidates can change over time. 

       You might want to use filters or search endpoints to find the committee you're looking for. Then you can use other committee endpoints to explore information about the committee that interests you. 

       Financial information is organized by `committee_id`, so finding the committee you're interested in will lead you to more granular financial information. 

       The committee endpoints include all FEC filers, even if they aren't registered as a committee. 

       Officially, committees include the committees and organizations that file with the FEC. Several different types of organizations file financial reports with the FEC: 

       *Campaign committees authorized by particular candidates to raise and spend funds in their campaigns. Non-party committees (e.g., PACs), some of which may be sponsored by corporations, unions, trade or membership groups, etc. Political party committees at the national, state, and local levels. Groups and individuals making only independent expenditures Corporations, unions, and other organizations making internal communications* 

       The committee endpoints primarily use data from FEC registration Form 1 and Form 2.

  - description: Reporting deadlines, election dates FEC meetings, events etc.
    name: dates
  - description: |-
      Fetch key information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports. 

       Most committees are required to summarize their financial activity in each filing; those summaries are included in these files. Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended. 

       Information is made available on the API as soon as it's processed. Keep in mind, complex paper filings take longer to process. 

       The financial endpoints use data from FEC [form 5](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm5.pdf), for independent expenditors; or the summary and detailed summary pages of the FEC [Form 3](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3.pdf), for House and Senate committees; [Form 3X](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3x.pdf), for PACs and parties; and [Form 3P](http://www.fec.gov/pdf/forms/fecfrm3p.pdf), for presidential committees.

      This collection of endpoints includes Schedule A records reported by a committee. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from individuals, use the /schedules/schedule_a/ endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our "is_individual" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/). 

       

       

       Schedule A is also available as a database dump file that is updated weekly on Sunday. The database dump files are here: https://www.fec.gov/files/bulk-downloads/index.html?prefix=bulk-downloads/data-dump/schedules/. The instructions are here: https://www.fec.gov/files//bulk-downloads/data-dump/schedules/README.txt. We cannot provide help with restoring the database dump files, but you can refer to this community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data) for discussion.

  - description: Schedule D, it shows debts and obligations owed to or by the committee that are required to be disclosed.

      Schedule E covers the line item expenditures for independent expenditures. For example, if a super PAC bought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate. 

       An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with, or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or a political party or its agents." 

       Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in `/schedule/schedule_e/`.

      The agency’s monitoring process may detect potential violations through a review of a committee’s reports or through a Commission audit. By law, all enforcement cases must remain confidential until they’re closed. 

       The Commission is required by law to audit Presidential campaigns that accept public funds. In addition, the Commission audits a committee when it appears not to have met the threshold requirements for substantial compliance with the Federal Election Campaign Act. The audit determines whether the committee complied with limitations, prohibitions and disclosure requirements. 

       These endpoints contain Final Audit Reports approved by the Commission since inception.

        Returns CSV or ICS for downloading directly into calendar applications like Google, Outlook or other applications.

        Combines the election and reporting dates with Commission meetings, conferences, outreach, Advisory Opinions, rules, litigation dates and other
        events into one calendar.

        State filtering now applies to elections, reports and reporting periods.

        Presidential pre-primary report due dates are not shown on even years.
        Filers generally opt to file monthly rather than submit over 50 pre-primary election
        reports. All reporting deadlines are available at /reporting-dates/ for reference.

        This is [the sql function](https://github.com/fecgov/openFEC/blob/develop/data/migrations/V40__omnibus_dates.sql)
        that creates the calendar.

            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

        Fetch basic information about candidates, and use parameters to filter results to the
        candidates you're looking for.

        Each result reflects a unique FEC candidate ID. That ID is particular to the candidate for a
        particular office sought. If a candidate runs for the same office multiple times, the ID
        stays the same. If the same person runs for another office — for example, a House
        candidate runs for a Senate office — that candidate will get a unique ID for each office.

        Find out a candidate's characteristics over time. This is particularly useful if the
        candidate runs for the same office in different districts or you want to know more about a candidate's
        previous races.

        This information is organized by `candidate_id`, so it won't help you find a candidate
        who ran for different offices over time; candidates get a new ID for each office.

            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,

        Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that
        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

        Key financial data reported periodically by committees as they are reported. This feed includes summary
        information from the the House F3 reports, the presidential F3p reports and the PAC and party
        F3x reports.

        Generally, committees file reports on a quarterly or monthly basis, but
        some must also submit a report 12 days before primary elections. Therefore, during the primary
        season, the period covered by this file may be different for different committees. These totals
        also incorporate any changes made by committees, if any report covering the period is amended.

        DISCLAIMER: The field labels contained within this resource are subject to change.  We are attempting to succinctly
        label these fields while conveying clear meaning to ensure accessibility for all users.

        Look at the top-level financial information for all candidates running for the same
        office.

        Choose a 2-year cycle, and `house`, `senate` or `presidential`.

        If you are looking for a Senate seat, you will need to select the state using a two-letter
        abbreviation.

        House races require state and a two-digit district number.

        Since this endpoint reflects financial information, it will only have candidates once they file
        financial reporting forms. Query the `/candidates` endpoint to retrieve an-up-to-date list of all the
        candidates that filed to run for a particular seat.

            an odd year and is named for its ending, even year. This cycle follows
            the traditional house election cycle and subdivides the presidential
            and Senate elections into comparable two-year blocks. To retrieve data for
            the entire four years of a presidential term or six years of a senatorial term,
            you will need the `election_full` flag.

        Each report represents the summary information from Form 3, Form 3X and Form 3P.
        These reports have key statistics that illuminate the financial status of a given committee.
        Things like cash on hand, debts owed by committee, total receipts, and total disbursements
        are especially helpful for understanding a committee's financial dealings.

        By default, this endpoint includes both amended and final versions of each report. To restrict
        to only the final versions of each report, use `is_amended=false`; to retrieve only reports that
        have been amended, use `is_amended=true`.

        Several different reporting structures exist, depending on the type of organization that
        submits financial information. To see an example of these reporting requirements,
        look at the summary and detailed summary pages of Form 3, Form 3X, and Form 3P.

      description: |+
        
        This description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.

        This endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our "is_individual" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).

        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. 
        For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:

        case #1:
        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 2152643,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880619",
                last_contribution_receipt_date: "2014-01-01"
            }
        }
        ```
        <br/>
        case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 2152644,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880639",
                sort_null_only: True
            }
        }
        ```
        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.

        Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.

        To avoid throwing the "out of range" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.

        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.

            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

        This description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.

        This endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our "is_individual" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/).

        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. 
        For example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:

        case #1:
        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 2152643,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880619",
                last_contribution_receipt_date: "2014-01-01"
            }
        }
        ```
        <br/>
        case #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 2152644,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 43052850,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230880639",
                sort_null_only: True
            }
        }
        ```
        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.

        Calls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.

        To avoid throwing the "out of range" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.

        ​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.

            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data
        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are
        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.

        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will
        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
        even-numbered year.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and
        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.
        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.
        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

        Schedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data
        explains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are
        reported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.

        The data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which
        is derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will
        default to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,
        even-numbered year.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
        pagination: {
            pages: 965191,
            per_page: 20,
            count: 19303814,
            last_indexes: {
                last_index: "230906248",
                last_disbursement_date: "2014-07-04"
            }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and
        `last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.
        `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.
        This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        the expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.

        An independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication "expressly advocating the election or
        defeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,
        or at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or
        a political party or its agents."

        Aggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures
        and the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in
        `/schedule/schedule_e/`.

        Due to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by
        page number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in
        the `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For
        example, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of
        results with the following pagination information:

        ```
         "pagination": {
            "count": 152623,
            "last_indexes": {
              "last_index": "3023037",
              "last_expenditure_amount": -17348.5
            },
            "per_page": 20,
            "pages": 7632
          }
        }
        ```

        To fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and
        `last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through
        these results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date,
        e.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally
        filtered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance
        and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.

        Note: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for
        large result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.

        This endpoint provides information about a committee's Form 3, Form 3X, or Form 3P financial reports,
        which are aggregated by two-year period. We refer to two-year periods as a `cycle`.

        The cycle is named after the even-numbered year and includes the year before it. To obtain
        totals from 2013 and 2014, you would use 2014. In odd-numbered years, the current cycle
        is the next year — for example, in 2015, the current cycle is 2016.

        For presidential and Senate candidates, multiple two-year cycles exist between elections.

            This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the
            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

            This is a two-year period that is derived from the year a transaction took place in the
            Itemized Schedule A and Schedule B tables. In cases where we have the date of the transaction
            (contribution_receipt_date in schedules/schedule_a, disbursement_date in schedules/schedule_b)
            the two_year_transaction_period is named after the ending, even-numbered year. If we do not
            have the date  of the transaction, we fall back to using the report year (report_year in both
            tables) instead,  making the same cycle adjustment as necessary. If no transaction year is
            specified, the results default to the most current cycle.

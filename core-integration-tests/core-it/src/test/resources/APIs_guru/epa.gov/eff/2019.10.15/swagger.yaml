  description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use.

    \  ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.

    \   EFF Rest Services provides the data for ECHO's Effluent Charts, a set of dynamic charts and tables of permitted effluent limits, releases, and violations over time for Clean Water Act (CWA) wastewater discharge permits issued under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES). \ 


    See Effluent Charts Help (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/effluent-charts-help) for additional information.

    \\

    The are 3 service end points for Effluent Charts:  get_summary_chart, get_effluent_chart, and download_effluent_chart.

    \\

    \ <b>1)</b>  Use get_summary_chart to retrieve a summary matrix of effluent parameters by effluent outfall and an overall violation status for a provided NPDES Permit and date range.

    \ <b>2)</b>  Use get_effluent_chart to retrieve detailed Discharge Limit, DMR and NPDES Violation information for a provided NPDES Permit, date range, effluent parameter, or outfall.

    \ <b>3)</b>  Use download_effluent_chart to generate a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file of the detailed data provided with get_effluent chart, for a provided NPDES Permit, date range, effluent parameter, or outfall.

The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.

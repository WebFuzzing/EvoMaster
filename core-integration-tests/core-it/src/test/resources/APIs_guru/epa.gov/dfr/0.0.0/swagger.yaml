  description: "Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) is a tool developed and maintained by EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance for public use. ECHO provides integrated compliance and enforcement information for over 1 million regulated facilities nationwide.


    DFR Rest Services provide multiple service endpoints, to retrieve detailed facility location, enforcement, compliance monitoring, and pollutant information for any single facility.  See the Detailed Facility Report (DFR) Help Page (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/detailed-facility-report-help) for additional information on the DFR.  Additionally, a Data Dictionary (https://echo.epa.gov/help/reports/dfr-data-dictionary) is also available.\ 

    There is one primary service end point, get_dfr, that provides all available DFR data.  All other service end points that are exposed, will return data on a single section of the DFR.   \

Under the CAA, federally reportable sources include majors, synthetic minors, NESHAP Part 61 minors, minors with an unresolved High Priority Violation (HPV), with recent enforcement actions, or included on a Compliance Monitoring Strategy plan. The Clean Air Act requires that delegated agencies and EPA track all federally reportable sources in Air Facility System (AFS).
          - For CWA  = Each CWA Source ID or National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit is defined by the program office as a Major or Minor discharger.
          - For RCRA = RCRA Source ID or permits for Treatment, Storage and Disposal facilities are identified by TSD, Large Quantity Generators are identified by LQG. Other values include Permit Workload (PMT), Closure Workload (CLO), Small Quantity Generator Universe (SQG), Conditionally-Exempt Small Quantity Generator (CESQG), Post-Closure Workload (POST CL), and Transporters.

EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.

          - Archived: The violation is not Resolved, but is more than five years past its compliance period end date. In keeping with the Enforcement Response Policy, the violation no longer contributes to the public water system's overall compliance status. Unresolved violations are also marked as Archived when a system ceases operations (becomes inactive).
          - Addressed: The violation is not Resolved or Archived, and is addressed by one or more formal enforcement actions.

          The EPA data system in which permit and facility records are kept. EPA's Facility Registry System (FRS) links all program database records (such as permit IDs and IDs facilities use in reporting to EPA) together. The following list describes the individual data systems that are linked to from the detailed facility report: 

          - AFS: Air Facility System for Clean Air Act stationary source programs.
          - ICP: Integrated Compliance Information System for Clean Water Act programs monitoring National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.
          - RCR: Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Information System (RCRAInfo) for tracking the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) programs.
          - NCDB: National Compliance Database System for monitoring national performance of the Toxic Substance Control Act (TSCA); the Emergency Planning and Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 (EPCRA); the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response (AHERA); and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).
          - TRI: Toxics Release Inventory for Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, Section 313 submissions.
          - NEI: National Emissions Inventory database contains information on stationary and mobile sources that emit criteria air pollutants and their precursors, as well as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). The database includes estimates of annual emissions, by source, of air pollutants in each area of the country, on an annual basis.
          - TSCA: Toxic Substances Control Act addressing the production, importation, use, and disposal of specific chemicals.

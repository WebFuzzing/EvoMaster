      Provide a trackingId and retrieve associated aliases. Search within aliases
      for associated trackers.

      A tracker often has to be associated with an external system in a way that is
      neither part of the reported state of the device or the desired state – attaching
      a tracker to a particular engine part or palette; assigning a human-readable name;
      synchronizing with an external asset management system. This service allows the
      association of arbitrary type-externalId pairs with a trackingId as well as the ability to
      search across those type-externalId pairs to find the containing trackingIds. External Id
      and type pair must be unique within an account.

      Service to manage device events.
    name: Events
  - description: |
      This service is used to manage the associations between devices and geofences.

      HERE Tracking generates a notification when a device crosses in or out of an associated geofence.
    name: Geofence Associations
  - description: |
      Create and manage geofences.

      A geofence is a boundary that you can define and associate with your devices.
      The area that the geofence encloses can be defined using geographic coordinates or radio measurements.
      When active, HERE Tracking can notify you when a device transitions in
      or out of a geofence.

      Circle and polygon geofences are usable both outdoors and indoors. The evaluation is based on the coordinates of the trace. POI (Point of Interest) geofence evaluation relies on the radio environment near the point of interest where the geofence was trained. POI geofences should only be used indoors.

      Service for managing locations.

      This is an Alpha version of the Locations API and can still be changed in future releases.

      Locations are geographical points of interest users may store in HERE Tracking. Locations are
      used as building blocks for shipments.

      Provide a trackingId, geofenceId or sensorRuleId and retrieve associated metadata. Update
      meta information for your resource.

      A tracker, geofence or sensor rule often has to be associated with metadata;
      adding descriptive information about it. This service allows the
      association of arbitrary JSON object with a trackingId, geofenceId or sensorRuleId.
    name: Metadata
  - description: |
      Manage notification channels for a user.

      Users can opt to receive notifications whenever one of their devices generates an event based on
      predefined event rule threshold values. The channel supported for notifications is webhook.

      Once a user has registered a URL as a webhook, the URL will receive a POST request whenever an
      event occurs. The API version used to register the webhook URL determines the body of the
      notification.

      <h2>v2</h2>

      Notifications sent to URLs registered at v2 API contain only geofence related events. The POST
      body is a JSON object that describes the event.

      ```
      {
        "inOut": "PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE",
        "geofenceId": "e2f651ee-f196-4fa3-bf88-894dc131dea3",

        "timestamp": 1499258184142,
        "notificationStatus": "SENT"
      }

      ```
      Possible values for `inOut` are:

       * PING_OUTSIDE_FENCE
       * PING_IN_FENCE

      <h2>v3</h2>

      Notifications sent to URLs registered at v3 API contain only events the user subscribed to when
      registering the webhook URL. The POST body is an array of JSON objects, each describing an
      event.

      <h2>Offline</h2>

      If a device has been working offline and caching position updates, notifications are not sent
      until the device is online again. All events are recorded in the events log.
    name: Notifications
  - description: |
      Create and get reports related to event data.

      To start report creation, make POST reports/v4 query and provide ruleId and start and end times
      of the report period in the request body. Supported rule types are:
      * dwelling
      * detention
      * utilization

      Reports are generated based on the event data generated by the rule and associated devices.
      As a response, you will get a `reportId`

      Once the report is generated, you can get various different versions of the report using the
      `reportId` and query parameters in a GET request.

      A sensor rule defines the sensor alarm threshold values. You can define and associate a sensor rule with

      your devices. HERE Tracking can notify you when a device sensor data falls within or outside the predefined

      threshold values.

      Shadows provide an effective way to manage configurations for devices that are online
      intermittently.

      Shadows are stored in HERE Tracking and contain two states of a device's configuration:
      The `reported` state and the `desired` state.

      The `reported` state contains the most recent position, sensor readings and settings that the
      device had sent when it was last online. The state is meant to be read by an application.

      The `desired` state contains settings that the device should use. The device will read these
      when it is online.

      > **IMPORTANT**
      > Devices should not communicate directly with this service. Devices must send telemetry
      > to the ingestion endpoint only. This telemetry data is used to update the `reported`
      > configuration for the device.

      Applications should only write to the `desired` configuration state and only read from
      `reported` configuration state.

      A `shipmentId` can be substituted for `trackingId` when fetching a shadow. This returns the
      shadow of the device that was most recently active for the provided shipment. If the shipment
      is still pending or it has been cancelled or completed, an empty shadow is returned.
    name: Shadows
  - description: |
      Service for managing shipments and shipment plans.

      This is an Alpha version of the Shipments API and can still be changed in future releases.

      A shipment describes a structure of a multimodal logistics journey. Shipments are useful when
      the lifetime of an asset you are tracking spans across multiple trackers.

      A shipment consists of segments that span from a location to another. The segments and their
      origins and destinations must form a continuous chain of locations i.e. the origin of a segment
      must match the destination of a previous segment. Each segment of the shipment may be assigned a
      `trackingId` that can alter between segments. Trackers assigned to a shipment generate traces
      and events for the shipment.

      The `shipmentId` of a shipment can be used in similar fashion than a trackingId in selected
      APIs. You can query for shipment ***traces*** and ***events*** and associate ***aliases*** and
      ***metadata*** to a shipment.

      Each shipment has one of the following statuses:
      * ***pending***: The shipment has not yet started.
      * ***ongoing***: The shipment has started and it has one segment ongoing.
      * ***completed***: The shipment has ended and all of its segments are completed.
      * ***cancelled***: The shipment has ended and it has one or more cancelled segments.

      HERE Tracking progresses the shipment automatically if each segment has been assigned a
      `trackingId` and the origin and destination locations contain a geofenceId. Each segment is
      started upon exiting the origin location of the segment and completed upon entering the
      destination location of the segment. If the origin and the destination of a segment share the
      same location (i.e. dwelling in single location), the segment is automatically started after the
      previous segment was completed. If a segment has not been assigned a tracker, the user must
      start and complete the segment manually.

      A new shipment should be instantiated for each separate logistical journey. However, if the
      structure of the shipment is recurring, a shipment plan can be defined. A shipment plan can
      be used to define a generic skeleton for a logistical journey. For example, often a sequence of
      locations is typical for certain types of assets. A shipment plan defining the segments can be
      created, and whenever a new logistical journey begins, a shipment can be instantiated from the
      plan. This allows recycling of components for similar shipments and reduces time and effort for
      creating new shipment instances.

      Use this API to access current and historical data that a device has collected.
      This data includes a history of the device position, payload, and timestamp.

      Use this API to access current and historical data about device transitions.

      A transition event is created each time a device enters or exists an associated
      geofence. These events are stored in the transition log.

        Gets all aliases on the account.

        If the request is supplied with `type` query parameter, the successful response will contain
        only aliases of the given type.

        If the request is supplied with `externalId` query parameter, the
        successful response will contain only aliases which match to given
        externalId. In this query it is possible to use wildcards:
        '*' matches to any number of any characters,
        '?' matches to any one character.

        If the request is supplied with `after` query parameter, the successful response will
        contain aliases created after the given timestamp.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results
        where the user has large amount of aliases.

        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with
        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates
        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of
        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. Using
        `after` parameter with `pageToken` is forbidden.

        The paginated results are returned in the order of the alias creation time.
        All aliases of a trackingId may therefore not fit in the same page.

        Returns all events for all devices and shipments within a specific time range. The results
        are listed in descending order based on the timestamp. Each event can be identified uniquely
        by trackingId-ruleId-timestamp key.

        A time range can be defined with before and after timestamps. A successful response contains
        an array of events that were recorded after the first timestamp and before the second.

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain
        events generated by the defined source.

        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified type.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will contain events
        for the specified ruleId.

        If the request is supplied with `initialState` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified initial state. Events for which the initialState property is `true`,
        represent the state where the device is initially whereas events for which the initialState
        property is `false`, represent a transition from a state to another.

        The aforementioned query parameters can be combined to get the specific event types for a
        specific event source for a specific time frame.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for the results where the device
        has large amount of events. Query parameter `count` is the number of records returned
        per page. If all the matching records could not fit the page, a `pageToken` is returned in
        the response body. To get the next page of matching records, supply the request with
        `pageToken` query parameter.

                  Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                  Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                  report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                  of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                  Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                  a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                  the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                  Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                  events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                  Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                  geofence associated to the device.

                  Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                  spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                  are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                  Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                  stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                  when the device starts moving again.

                  Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                  UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                  stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                  Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                  inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

    get:
      description: |
        Returns all events for a device or a shipment within a specific time range. The results are
        listed in descending order based on the timestamp. Each event can be identified uniquely by
        trackingId-ruleId-timestamp key. A single event can be fetched using ruleId, before and
        after query parameters.

        A time range can be defined with before and after timestamps. A successful response contains
        an array of events that were recorded after the first timestamp and before the second.

        If the request is supplied with `eventSource` query parameter, the response will contain
        events generated by the defined source.

        If the request is supplied with `eventType` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified type.

        If the request is supplied with `ruleId` query parameter, the response will contain events
        for the specified ruleId.

        If the request is supplied with `initialState` query parameter, the response will contain
        events of the specified initial state. Events for which the initialState property is `true`,
        represent the state where the device is initially whereas events for which the initialState
        property is `false`, represent a transition from a state to another.

        The aforementioned query parameters can be combined to get the specific event types for a
        specific event source for a specific time frame.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for the results where the device
        has large amount of events. Query parameter `count` is the number of records returned
        per page. If all the matching records could not fit the page, a `pageToken` is returned in
        the response body. To get the next page of matching records, supply the request with
        `pageToken` query parameter.

                  Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                  Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                  report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                  of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                  Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                  a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                  the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                  Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                  events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                  Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                  geofence associated to the device.

                  Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                  spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                  are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                  Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                  stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                  when the device starts moving again.

                  Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                  UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                  stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                  Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                  inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                    Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                    report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                    of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                    a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for

        You can specify a geofence as a circle, as a polygon or as POI (Point of Interest). You can also assign a name and a description to each geofence to help identify them.

        Circle
        ---

        Specify the coordinates of the center point of the circle and a radius in
        meters.

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Home",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 100
              },
              "description": "Small area around my house."
            }
        ```

        Polygon
        ---

        Specify an array of points. A minimum of three points are required.

        *NOTE: If the points do not describe a closed polygon, the polygon is
        automatically closed between the last and first points.*

        ```json
            {
              "name": "Work",
              "type": "polygon",
              "definition": {
                "points": [{
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.530443,
                  "lng": 13.38482003
                }, {
                  "lat": 52.5308298,
                  "lng": 13.38492235
                }]
              },
              "description": "The area around work."
            }
        ```
        Indoor geofence
        ---
        In addition to previous definition, you can also define the floor properties of the geofence.
        ```json
            {
              "name": "Office indoor",
              "type": "circle",
              "definition": {
                "center": {
                  "lat": 52.5308398,
                  "lng": 13.38490035
                },
                "radius": 20,
                "floor": {
                  "level": 2,
                  "id": "DM_1234"
                  "name": "Office floor 2"
                }
              },
              "description": "Floor 2 of the office."
            }

        ```
        POI geofence
        ---

        Specify details of the POI geofence. POI geofence needs to be trained separately so that POI geofence events can be evaluated.
        ```json
            {
              "name": "POI room in the office",
              "type": "poi",
              "definition": {
                "location": {
                  "room": ROOM_201,
                  "address": Invalidenstrasse 116,
                  "country": Germany,
                  "position": {
                    "lat": 52.5308398,
                    "lng": 13.38490035
                  }
                },
                "floor": {
                  "level": 2,
                  "id": "DM_1234"
                  "name": "Office floor 2"
                }
              },
              "description": "A room where things should be delivered."
            }
        ```

        Successful requests have the HTTP status 201 and the response body provides
        the ID of the created geofence.

        Trains a POI geofence using device telemetry. The telemetry used for training can be defined by specifying a
        tracking ID and a time range. These parameters define the time when the device has been in the desired point of interest.
        Only telemetries that have been ingested during the last 24 hours can be used in the training.

        Optionally, a WLAN-scan be used for training.

                              Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                              report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                              of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                              geofence associated to the device.

                              Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                              spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                              are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                              Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                              stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                              when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                              UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                              stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                              Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                              whereas the rest of the events represent a transition from a state to another.

                    Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                    Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                    report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                    of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                    Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                    a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                    the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                    Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                    events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                    Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                    geofence associated to the device.

                    Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                    spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                    are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                    Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                    stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                    when the device starts moving again.

                    Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                    UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                    stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                    Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                    inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                                    Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                                    a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                                    the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                                    Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                                    events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                                    Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                                    geofence associated to the device.

                                    Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                                    spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                                    are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                                    Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                                    stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                                    when the device starts moving again.

                                    Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                                    UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                                    stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                                    Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                                    inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                    spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                    are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                    Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                    stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                    when the device starts moving again.

                    Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                    UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                    stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                    Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets

                              Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                              Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                              report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                              of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                              Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                              a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                              the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                              Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                              events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                              Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                              geofence associated to the device.

                              Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                              spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                              are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                              Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                              stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                              when the device starts moving again.

                              Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                              UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                              stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                              Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                              inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

        Claim a device to a user. Before a device is claimed, it cannot complete
        login and any data sent to the ingestion endpoint will be ignored. Once a
        device is claimed, its data is stored and available to its owner.

        When a device is claimed, it will be assigned a trackingID. This is the
        identifier in HERE Tracking that the data is associated with. Having a
        separate deviceId and trackingId means that devices can have their ownership
        transferred without having to create and install a new deviceId and
        deviceSecret.

        Only users with a valid Tracking license are authorized to claim
        new devices. Claimed devices must be associated with owner
        application ID, which is used when incrementing device usage
        for billing purposes.

        Starts a batch job to create credentials for either physical devices or virtual devices. Virtual devices are meant for cloud-to-cloud use case.
        Credentials for physical devices are deviceId and deviceSecret. Batch job creates number of physical devices specified by the 'count' parameter in the request body.
        Virtual devices are identified with an external device ID and request sender's appId. The virtual device external ID is application specific and user is free to allocate it as user finds suitable. The external IDs for the virtual devices to be created are specified in the 'devices' array in request body. For virtual devices the response contains only deviceId, no deviceSecret.
        The autoclaim parameter can only be used when creating virtual devices. If autoclaim=true, the created virtual devices are immediately bound to the requesting account. In this case the response contains also external IDs and tracking IDs for the claimed devices.

        Starts report generation.

        The request body contains ruleId, start date, and end date. Supported rule types are:
        * dwelling
        * detention
        * utilization

        Reports are generated based on the event data generated by the rule and associated devices.
        A `reportId` will be provided in the response.

        The report will be available for one week after which it needs to be created again. If a request
        matches an already generated report that is not yet expired, the previously generated report's ID
        is returned and no new report is generated.

        Note that the report should not be created with a time period that is in the future, as data
        ingested after creation of the report is not updated in the report.

            ID of the geofence.

            You can provide a geofence ID in case you want to get reports focused on a specific geofence.
            This parameter can only be used with report type dwelling.

            E.g. Get a report of assets' average dwelling time in the specified geofence during each week by providing
            * `reportId` of a dwelling rule and the period
            * `geofenceId`

            Defines how the result values should be grouped.

            When `interval` and `method`: 'cumulative' or 'average' is given, `groupBy` parameter defines
            over which affair (asset or geofence) the average/cumulative value is calculated.
            Method 'geofence' is only possible for dwelling reports.

            E.g. if you want to know, on average, how many times assets were in detention during each interval, provide
            * `reportId` of a detention rule and the period
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'
            * `method`: 'average'
            * `measure`: 'occurrence'

            If you want to know how long did all assets dwell inside each geofence during report period, provide
            * `reportId` of a dwelling rule and the period
            * `groupBy`: 'geofence'
            * `measure`: 'duration'

            If you want to know how log each asset dwelled (inside any geofence) during report period, provide
            * `reportId` of a dwelling rule and the period
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'
            * `measure`: 'duration'
          in: query
          name: groupBy
          required: false
          schema:
            enum:

            type: string
        - description: |
            Defines which method should be used for calculation. The parameter `method` can only be
            provided along with `interval`.

            You can provide `percentage` only when `measure` is 'asset'. E.g. to get to know what
            percentage of assets were used during each week, provide
            * `reportId` of a utilization rule and the period
            * `interval`: 'week'
            * `method`: 'percentage'
            * `measure`: 'asset'

            When combining 'cumulative'/'average' method with `measure`: 'duration'/'occurrence',
            `groupBy` parameter is needed to define over which entity to calculate the average/cumulative
            value. E.g. to get to know in total, how long all assets dwelled in specified geofence during
            each week, provide
            * `reportId` of a dwelling rule and the period
            * `geofenceId`
            * `interval`: 'week'
            * `method`: 'cumulative'
            * `measure`: 'duration'
            * `groupBy`: 'asset'

            When combining 'cumulative'/'average' method with `measure`: 'day', `groupBy` parameter is
            automatically 'asset'. E.g. to get report of on average, how many days were an asset used
            during each month, provide
            * `reportId` of a utilization rule and the period
            * `interval`: 'month'
            * `method`: 'average'

        Specify rule type and define threshold.

        Detention rule
        ---
        A detention rule can be created by defining the rule type to be `detention` and providing a
        threshold duration in seconds.
        When detention rule is associated to a device, a `DETENTION_STARTED` event gets triggered when
        the device has been continuously stationary longer than the threshold duration.
        `DETENTION_ENDED` event will be generated when the device starts moving again.

        Utilization rule
        ---
        A utilization rule can be created by defining the rule type to be `utilization` and providing a
        threshold duration in seconds.
        When utilization rule is associated to a device, a `UTILIZED` event is triggered when the asset
        starts moving to indicate the asset is utilized, and `UNUTILIZED` event will be generated when
        the asset stops moving and has been stationary longer than the threshold duration to indicate
        the asset is unutilized.

        Dwelling rule
        ---
        A dwelling rule can be created by defining the rule type to be `dwelling` and providing a
        threshold duration in seconds.
        When dwelling rule is associated to a device, a `DWELLING_STARTED` event gets triggered when
        the dwelling time inside any associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration.
        When the device then exits the geofence, `DWELLING_ENDED` event will be generated.

        Stock rule
        ---
        Stock rule can be created by defining rule type to be `stock`, providing a
        `geofenceId` and a threshold for `minVolume` and/or `maxVolume`.
        When the number of assets inside the specified geofence exceeds `maxVolume`, an `OVERSTOCK`
        event will be generated. Similarly when the number of assets inside the specified geofence
        goes below `minVolume`, an `UNDERSTOCK` event will be generated. When the number of
        assets inside the specified geofence is between `minVolume` and `maxVolume`, a `NORMAL_VOLUME`
        event will be generated. Note that the stock rule only detects the assets that are associated
        to the specified geofence.

        Successful requests have the HTTP status 201 and the response body provides the ID of the created rule.

        Provides shadow objects for multiple devices. You can get shadows for a
        maximum of 100 devices per request.

        By providing `after` timestamp parameter the request will return only
        those shadow objects that were modified at or after the timestamp given
        in `after`. If `after` is not supplied it defaults to 0.

        Each returned shadow object consists of these properties:

        * `body` - The data that Shadows persists for the device (included on success)
        * `statusCode` - HTTP status code of the Shadows data, 200 indicates success, other values an error
        * `trackingId` - Tracking ID of the device the data is associated with (included when `appId` is not provided)
        * `appId` - Application identifier (included when `appId` is provided)
        * `externalId` - Application specific external ID (included when `appId` is provided)

You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                              Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                              Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

        Gets the value for a single property in the given state. You can use
        JSON selectors to select values for `desired` or `reported` properties.
        You can also reference a property by name, but if the property contains
        an object, the entire object is returned rather than a distinct value.

        The JSON selector can be nested like this: `payload/time/minutes`

        Creates a new shipment. A shipment consists of segments each representing a part of the
        logistics journey. A segment spans from a location to another and each segment may be
        assigned a different tracker.

        The segments of the shipment must form a continuous chain of locations i.e. the origin of a
        segment must match the destination of a previous segment.

        Creates a new shipment plan. A shipment plan is a structure that holds information about a
        recurring shipment. Like a shipment, a shipment plan also consists of segments each
        representing a part of the logistics journey. A segment spans from a location to another and
        each segment may be assigned a different tracker. The segments of the shipment must form a
        continuous chain of locations i.e. the origin of a segment must match the destination of a
        previous segment.

        In addition to shipments, a predefined duration can be assigned to each segment in the plan.
        This information will be used to calculate the Estimated Time of Departure (ETD) and
        Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) values when instantiating a shipment from a shipment plan.

        Updates the shipment plan details. This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided
        fields will be updated. If `ruleIds` field is given, it will replace
        the existing rules for the shipment plan.

        ***Note***:
        `segments` cannot be edited through this API. Changing the order of the segments in a plan
        would cause shipments created from earlier versions of the plan to diverge from any shipment
        instantiated from the new plan with different segment structure. Individual segments can
        still be updated through shipment plan API.

        Updates the shipment details. This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided
        fields will be updated.

        Changing the status of the shipment affects the statuses of the segments. The following
        status changes are allowed:
        * `pending` → `ongoing`
          * changes the status of the first segment to `ongoing`
        * `pending` → `cancelled`
          * changes the status of all segments to `cancelled`
        * `ongoing` → `cancelled`
          * cancels the current `ongoing` segment and all the succeeding segments
        * `ongoing` → `completed`
          * completes the current `ongoing` segment and cancels all the succeeding segments

        ***Note***:
        `segments` and `autoStart` can be updated through this API only if the shipment is in
        `pending` state.

        Updates the segment details. This is a partial update, meaning that only the provided fields
        will be updated.

        Changing the status of a segment affects the statuses of other segments in the shipment. The
        following status changes are allowed:
        * `pending` → `ongoing`
          * changes previous `pending` segments to `cancelled`
          * changes previous `ongoing` segment to `completed` (only for the immediate predecessor of
            this segment)
          * changes previous `ongoing` segment to `cancelled` (for segments that are not immediate
            predecessor of this segment)
          * previous segments in `cancelled` or `completed` states are not affected
        * `pending` || `ongoing` → `cancelled`
          * no side effects to other segments
        * `ongoing` → `completed`
          * next segment with status `pending` is changed to `ongoing`

        ***Note***:
        `trackingId` can be updated through this API only if the segment is in `pending` state.

    get:
      description: |
        Gets all traces that were recorded within the specified time range. Define the range with
        `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful response contains an array of traces that
        were recorded between (and including) `before` and `after` timestamps.

        If the trackingId is substituted with a valid shipmentId, the returned trace response is a
        composition of the traces of each segment. Traces are only returned for segments in
        `ongoing` and `completed` state.

        The `outliers` parameter can be used to select only traces that have
        been marked as outliers (if the parameter value is true), or only traces
        that have not been marked as outliers (if the parameter value is false).
        If the `outliers` parameter is not present, all traces will be returned,
        both nonoutliers and outliers.

        Traces are returned as an array in descending order based on timestamp.

        Note:
        ---
        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.

        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults to the current
        system time.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results where a large volume
        of data matches the given time range.

        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with a `pageToken`
        property in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates the next available page
        in the matching result set. To get the next page of records, submit `pageToken` as a query
        parameter in your next request. Using the `pageToken` query parameter will override any
        additional `before` and `after` parameters.

        The default number of records per page is 1000, which is also the maximum number of records
        per page.

        In case of success, the response body contains an array of trace samples between the given
        timestamps (after <= timestamp <= before).

        Gets all transitions that were recorded within a specific time range.
        You define the range with `before` and `after` timestamps. A successful
        response contains an array of transitions that were recorded after the
        first timestamp and before the second.

        Transitions are listed in descending order based on the timestamp.

        Note:
        ---

        To ensure a fast response, always provide both `before` and `after` timestamps.

        If no values are supplied `after` defaults to 0, and `before` defaults
        to the current system time.

        The `count` and `pageToken` parameters provide pagination for results
        where a large volume of data matches the given time range.

        In this case, `count` is the number of records returned per page along with
        a `pageToken` header in the returned HTTP response. The `pageToken` indicates
        the next available page in the matching result set. To get the next page of
        records, submit `pageToken` as a query parameter in your next request. The default
        number of records per page is 100, which is also the maximum number of
        records per page.

                                            Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

        A device uses its access token to send data to HERE Tracking.

        If the request is set to be synchronous, the response will be
        the desired state of the device shadow. If the request is set
        to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.

        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain
        either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for
        details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The
        more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the
        device's position.

        If a `scan` is provided, HERE Tracking will resolve the position asynchronously
        and return the desired state. The reported shadow will then be updated
        immediately after responding.

        A device uses its access token to send data to HERE Tracking or owner sends data on behalf of a device.

        If owner ingests data on behalf of a device, the device can be either real or virtual device. Real device is identified with a tracking ID obtained from HERE Tracking. Virtual device is identified with application specific external ID and App ID which identifies the application.

        By default the request is synchronous and the response will be the desired state of the device shadow. If the request is set to be asynchronous, the response will be empty.

        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the device's position.

        If a `scan` is provided, HERE Tracking will resolve the position asynchronously and return the desired state. The reported shadow will then be updated immediately after responding.

                          Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

        Owner sends data to HERE Tracking on behalf of multiple devices.

        Single request can contain data for multiple devices. If the devices are virtual devices, they are identified with application specific external ID and App ID which identifies the application. Real devices are identified with tracking ID obtained from HERE Tracking.

        To have a position associated with a device, the request body must contain either a `position` or a `scan` object (see the object definitions for details). If both are provided, the `scan` is resolved to a `position`. The more accurate of the two positions (provided and resolved) is used as the device's position.

            Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
            report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
            of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

            Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
            a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
            the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

            Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
            events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

            spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
            are generated when the dwelling period ends.

            Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
            stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
            when the device starts moving again.

            Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
            UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
            stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                          Type of the event. Event types depend on the data the device sends.

                          Sensors that report numerical measurement data (battery, humidity, pressure and temperature)
                          report values inside or outside the rule range. Therefore the event generated by the crossing
                          of the rule limits causes BELOW_RANGE, IN_RANGE and ABOVE_RANGE event types.

                          Sensors that report boolean data (attach, tamper) generate events when they transition from
                          a state to another. When a device previously reported false but then reported true value for
                          the sensor generates a FALSE_TO_TRUE event (and vice versa for the TRUE_TO_FALSE event).

                          Sensors that report data when a monitored event occurs (e.g. the tracker was dropped) generate
                          events of type EVENT. They are not dependent on previous values sent by the device.

                          Events of type INSIDE_GEOFENCE and OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE are generated when the device enters or exits
                          geofence associated to the device.

                          Events of type DWELLING_STARTED are generated when the time a device has
                          spent inside an associated geofence exceeds the threshold duration. DWELLING_ENDED events
                          are generated when the dwelling period ends.

                          Events of type DETENTION_STARTED are generated when the device has been continuously
                          stationary longer than the threshold duration. DETENTION_ENDED events will be generated
                          when the device starts moving again.

                          Events of type UTILIZED are generated when the device starts moving.
                          UNUTILIZED events are generated when the device stops moving and also has been continuously
                          stationary longer than the threshold duration.

                          Events of type OVERSTOCK, NORMAL_VOLUME and UNDERSTOCK are generated when the number of assets
                          inside a geofence cross the minVolume and maxVolume thresholds of an associated stock rule.

                          Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

                    Tracking can be disabled and enabled by defining disableTracking object. In order to disable tracking, you must at least provide the begin time of the disabling period and define either position or sensor properties you want to disable. You can also disable both position and sensors at the same time. By default tracking is enabled.

It is recommended to have dedicated credentials for logging in to the external cloud in order not to violate possible concurrent users policies of the external cloud. For the case of the HERE Tracking loopback driver, the maximum allowed concurrent user account tokens for an account is 3, therefore it is recommended to create a separate HERE account and grant it the required privilege to update the connector's project, and use that account in externalCloudInfo.

        The parameter `value` refers to the `measure` parameter.

        * `measure`: `occurrence` => `value`: number of event periods during the time frame
        * `measure`: `day`, => `value`: number of days when the event happened over time frame
        * `measure`: `asset`, => `value`: number of assets for which the event happened over the time frame

        When `value` is provided with `timestamp`, the time frame is the specified interval.
        When value is provided with `trackingId` or `geofenceId`, the time frame is the whole report start-end period.

        Additionally, if `method` parameter is given, the `value` represents
        average/cumulative/percentage of the measured value.

    signedRequest:
      description: |
        HERE Tracking requires that you sign your requests for tokens. The signature method uses the OAuth 1.0 standard. For more information on this standard, see the [OAuth Core 1.0](https://oauth.net/core/1.0/) specification.

        > **Note:** You must create a new signature for each token request to HERE Tracking. Signatures can only be used once.

        Create the Signature Base String
        ---

        The first step in creating a signature is to create the signature base string. This string contains the parameters to use when generating the signature.

        *1. To begin, make sure you have the information listed in the following table.*

        | Parameter                | Description                              |
        | ------------------------ | -----------------------------------------|
        | oauth\_consumer\_key     | The device ID for which you want to generate a token. |
        | oauth\_signature\_method | Always use "HMAC-SHA256".                 |
        | oauth\_timestamp         | The number of seconds since the Unix epoch at the point the request is generated. This must be within 10 seconds of the timestamp returned by the `/v2/timestamp` endpoint. |
        | oauth\_nonce             | A unique string for this signature. The string cannot have been used in a previous signature. Each token generation request to HERE Tracking must have a unique signature, and the value in this parameter is what is used to ensure the signature is unique. |
        | oauth\_version           | Always use "1.0".                         |

        *2. Combine these values into a single string by following these steps:*

           1. URL encode every key and value.
           2. Sort the list of key-value pairs alphabetically by key.
           3. Concatenate each key/value pair, separating each with an ampersand character ("&").

        The result is a parameter string that looks like this (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           oauth_consumer_key=47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2
           &oauth_nonce=LIIpk4
           &oauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA256
           &oauth_timestamp=1513634609
           &oauth_version=1.0
           ```

        *3. Combine the HTTP method, base URL, and parameter string into a single string called the "base string". This will be the string from which the signature is generated. The base string is in this format:*

           ```
           POST&https://tracking.api.here.com/v2/token&<URL encoded parameter string>
           ```

           The base string consists of:

           1. The HTTP method in caps (POST) followed by an ampersand ("&")
           2. The URL of the HERE Tracking token endpoint followed by an ampersand ("&")
           3. The URL-encoded parameter string.

           For example (line breaks are added for legibility):

           ```
           POST
            &https%3A%2F%2Ftracking.api.here.com%2Fv2%2Ftoken
            &oauth_consumer_key%3D47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2%26
            oauth_nonce%3DLIIpk4%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA256%26
            oauth_timestamp%3D1513634609%26oauth_version%3D1.0
           ```

           > **Note:** The URL-encoded base string should contain exactly two ampersands ("&").

        Create the signature
        ---

        The signing key used to sign the base string is the `deviceSecret` followed by an ampersand ("&").

        Create the signature by passing the signature base string and the signing key to the `HMAC-SHA256` hashing algorithm and converting the result to a `base64` string. Then, use the signature to request a token.

        Request the token
        ---

        Make a `POST` request to this endpoint with an `Authorization` header constructed from the above parameters and the generated signature.

        Example:

        ```
            Authorization: OAuth oauth_consumer_key="47164fb0-b7b3-49e8-891b-650270b82cf2",
                oauth_signature_method="HMAC-SHA256",
                oauth_timestamp="1513634609",
                oauth_nonce="LIIpk4",
                oauth_version="1.0",
                oauth_signature="pQ9EJX14L736B%2Br7uZl4yQlO6Xw%3D"
        ```
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      type: apiKey

When using this method, specify the feedType and filterCriteria including both evaluationMarketplaceId and customerServiceMetricType for the report. The method returns the location response header containing the call URI to use with getCustomerServiceMetricTask to retrieve status and details on the task. Only CURRENT Customer Service Metrics reports can be generated with the Sell Feed API. PROJECTED reports are not supported at this time. See the getCustomerServiceMetric method document in the Analytics API for more information about these two types of reports. Note: Before calling this API, retrieve the summary of the seller's performance and rating for the customer service metric by calling getCustomerServiceMetric (part of the Analytics API). You can then populate the create task request fields with the values from the response. This technique eliminates failed tasks that request a report for a customerServiceMetricType and evaluationMarketplaceId that are without evaluation."

Specify the same feedType as the feedType of the associated schedule template. When creating the schedule, if available from the template, you can specify a preferred trigger hour, day of the week, or day of the month. These and other fields are conditionally available as specified by the template. Note: Make sure to include all fields required by the schedule template (scheduleTemplateId). Call the getScheduleTemplate method (or the getScheduleTemplates method), to find out which fields are required or optional. If a field is optional and a default value is provided by the template, the default value will be used if omitted from the payload.A successful call returns the location response header containing the getSchedule call URI to retrieve the schedule you just created. The URL includes the eBay-assigned schedule ID, which you can use to reference the schedule task. To retrieve the details of the create schedule task, use the getSchedule method for a single schedule ID or the getSchedules method to retrieve all schedule details for the specified feed_type. The number of schedules for each feedType is limited. Error code 160031 is returned when you have reached this maximum. Note: Except for schedules with a HALF-HOUR frequency, all schedules will ideally run at the start of each hour ('00' minutes).

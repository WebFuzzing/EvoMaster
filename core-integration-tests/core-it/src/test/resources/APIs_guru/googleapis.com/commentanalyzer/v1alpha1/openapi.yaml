  description: The Perspective Comment Analyzer API provides information about the potential impact of a comment on a conversation (e.g. it can provide a score for the "toxicity" of a comment). Users can leverage the "SuggestCommentScore" method to submit corrections to improve Perspective over time. Users can set the "doNotStore" flag to ensure that all submitted comments are automatically deleted after scores are returned.

To specify an overall attribute score for the entire comment as a whole, use the `summary_score` field of the mapped AttributeScores object. To specify scores on specific subparts of the comment, use the `span_scores` field. All SpanScore objects must have begin and end fields set. All Score objects must be explicitly set (for binary classification, use the score values 0 and 1). If Score objects don't include a ScoreType, `PROBABILITY` is assumed. `attribute_scores` must not be empty. The mapped AttributeScores objects also must not be empty. An `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned for all malformed requests.

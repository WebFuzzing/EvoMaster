          description: All container images are typically downloaded before any actions are executed. This helps prevent typos in URIs or issues like lack of disk space from wasting large amounts of compute resources. If set, this flag prevents the worker from downloading the image until just before the action is executed.

The other actions do not need the `enable_fuse` flag to access the mounted filesystem. This has the effect of causing the container to be executed with `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` and exposes `/dev/fuse` to the container, so use it only for containers you trust.

In addition to the values passed here, a few other values are automatically injected into the environment. These cannot be hidden or overwritten. `GOOGLE_PIPELINE_FAILED` will be set to "1" if the pipeline failed because an action has exited with a non-zero status (and did not have the `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flag set). This can be used to determine if additional debug or logging actions should execute. `GOOGLE_LAST_EXIT_STATUS` will be set to the exit status of the last non-background action that executed. This can be used by workflow engine authors to determine whether an individual action has succeeded or failed.
          type: object
        ignoreExitStatus:
          description: Normally, a non-zero exit status causes the pipeline to fail. This flag allows execution of other actions to continue instead.

        imageUri:
          description: Required. The URI to pull the container image from. Note that all images referenced by actions in the pipeline are pulled before the first action runs. If multiple actions reference the same image, it is only pulled once, ensuring that the same image is used for all actions in a single pipeline. The image URI can be either a complete host and image specification (e.g., quay.io/biocontainers/samtools), a library and image name (e.g., google/cloud-sdk) or a bare image name ('bash') to pull from the default library. No schema is required in any of these cases. If the specified image is not public, the service account specified for the Virtual Machine must have access to pull the images from GCR, or appropriate credentials must be specified in the google.cloud.lifesciences.v2beta.Action.credentials field.

The host port number must be less than 65536. If it is zero, an unused random port is assigned. To determine the resulting port number, consult the `ContainerStartedEvent` in the operation metadata.
          type: object
        publishExposedPorts:
          description: Exposes all ports specified by `EXPOSE` statements in the container. To discover the host side port numbers, consult the `ACTION_STARTED` event in the operation metadata.

        runInBackground:
          description: This flag allows an action to continue running in the background while executing subsequent actions. This is useful to provide services to other actions (or to provide debugging support tools like SSH servers).
          type: boolean
        timeout:
          description: The maximum amount of time to give the action to complete. If the action fails to complete before the timeout, it will be terminated and the exit status will be non-zero. The pipeline will continue or terminate based on the rules defined by the `ALWAYS_RUN` and `IGNORE_EXIT_STATUS` flags.

This option is provided to allow testing against the beta release of the operating system to ensure that the new version does not interact negatively with production pipelines. To test a pipeline against the beta release of Container-Optimized OS, use the value `projects/cos-cloud/global/images/family/cos-beta`.

The value of this parameter must be a valid Compute Engine CPU platform name (such as "Intel Skylake"). This parameter is only useful for carefully optimized work loads where the CPU platform has a significant impact.

        dockerCacheImages:
          description: The Compute Engine Disk Images to use as a Docker cache. The disks will be mounted into the Docker folder in a way that the images present in the cache will not need to be pulled. The digests of the cached images must match those of the tags used or the latest version will still be pulled. The root directory of the ext4 image must contain `image` and `overlay2` directories copied from the Docker directory of a VM where the desired Docker images have already been pulled. Any images pulled that are not cached will be stored on the first cache disk instead of the boot disk. Only a single image is supported.

You can include grid data in one of 2 ways: * Specify a field mask listing your desired fields using the `fields` URL parameter in HTTP * Set the includeGridData URL parameter to true. If a field mask is set, the `includeGridData` parameter is ignored For large spreadsheets, as a best practice, retrieve only the specific spreadsheet fields that you want. To retrieve only subsets of spreadsheet data, use the ranges URL parameter. Ranges are specified using [A1 notation](/sheets/api/guides/concepts#cell). You can define a single cell (for example, `A1`) or multiple cells (for example, `A1:D5`). You can also get cells from other sheets within the same spreadsheet (for example, `Sheet2!A1:C4`) or retrieve multiple ranges at once (for example, `?ranges=A1:D5&ranges=Sheet2!A1:C4`). Limiting the range returns only the portions of the spreadsheet that intersect the requested ranges."

      description: Appends values to a spreadsheet. The input range is used to search for existing data and find a "table" within that range. Values will be appended to the next row of the table, starting with the first column of the table. See the [guide](/sheets/api/guides/values#appending_values) and [sample code](/sheets/api/samples/writing#append_values) for specific details of how tables are detected and data is appended. The caller must specify the spreadsheet ID, range, and a valueInputOption. The `valueInputOption` only controls how the input data will be added to the sheet (column-wise or row-wise), it does not influence what cell the data starts being written to.

      description: Applies one or more updates to the spreadsheet. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. The replies will mirror the requests. For example, if you applied 4 updates and the 3rd one had a reply, then the response will have 2 empty replies, the actual reply, and another empty reply, in that order. Due to the collaborative nature of spreadsheets, it is not guaranteed that the spreadsheet will reflect exactly your changes after this completes, however it is guaranteed that the updates in the request will be applied together atomically. Your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the spreadsheet should reflect your changes.

This method differs from GetSpreadsheet in that it allows selecting which subsets of spreadsheet data to return by specifying a dataFilters parameter. Multiple DataFilters can be specified. Specifying one or more data filters returns the portions of the spreadsheet that intersect ranges matched by any of the filters. By default, data within grids is not returned. You can include grid data one of 2 ways: * Specify a field mask listing your desired fields using the `fields` URL parameter in HTTP * Set the includeGridData parameter to true. If a field mask is set, the `includeGridData` parameter is ignored For large spreadsheets, as a best practice, retrieve only the specific spreadsheet fields that you want."

    Color:
      description: "Represents a color in the RGBA color space. This representation is designed for simplicity of conversion to/from color representations in various languages over compactness. For example, the fields of this representation can be trivially provided to the constructor of `java.awt.Color` in Java; it can also be trivially provided to UIColor's `+colorWithRed:green:blue:alpha` method in iOS; and, with just a little work, it can be easily formatted into a CSS `rgba()` string in JavaScript. This reference page doesn't carry information about the absolute color space that should be used to interpret the RGB value (e.g. sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3, BT.2020, etc.). By default, applications should assume the sRGB color space. When color equality needs to be decided, implementations, unless documented otherwise, treat two colors as equal if all their red, green, blue, and alpha values each differ by at most 1e-5. Example (Java): import com.google.type.Color; // ... public static java.awt.Color fromProto(Color protocolor) { float alpha = protocolor.hasAlpha() ? protocolor.getAlpha().getValue() : 1.0; return new java.awt.Color( protocolor.getRed(), protocolor.getGreen(), protocolor.getBlue(), alpha); } public static Color toProto(java.awt.Color color) { float red = (float) color.getRed(); float green = (float) color.getGreen(); float blue = (float) color.getBlue(); float denominator = 255.0; Color.Builder resultBuilder = Color .newBuilder() .setRed(red / denominator) .setGreen(green / denominator) .setBlue(blue / denominator); int alpha = color.getAlpha(); if (alpha != 255) { result.setAlpha( FloatValue .newBuilder() .setValue(((float) alpha) / denominator) .build()); } return resultBuilder.build(); } // ... Example (iOS / Obj-C): // ... static UIColor* fromProto(Color* protocolor) { float red = [protocolor red]; float green = [protocolor green]; float blue = [protocolor blue]; FloatValue* alpha_wrapper = [protocolor alpha]; float alpha = 1.0; if (alpha_wrapper != nil) { alpha = [alpha_wrapper value]; } return [UIColor colorWithRed:red green:green blue:blue alpha:alpha]; } static Color* toProto(UIColor* color) { CGFloat red, green, blue, alpha; if (![color getRed:&red green:&green blue:&blue alpha:&alpha]) { return nil; } Color* result = [[Color alloc] init]; [result setRed:red]; [result setGreen:green]; [result setBlue:blue]; if (alpha <= 0.9999) { [result setAlpha:floatWrapperWithValue(alpha)]; } [result autorelease]; return result; } // ... Example (JavaScript): // ... var protoToCssColor = function(rgb_color) { var redFrac = rgb_color.red || 0.0; var greenFrac = rgb_color.green || 0.0; var blueFrac = rgb_color.blue || 0.0; var red = Math.floor(redFrac * 255); var green = Math.floor(greenFrac * 255); var blue = Math.floor(blueFrac * 255); if (!('alpha' in rgb_color)) { return rgbToCssColor(red, green, blue); } var alphaFrac = rgb_color.alpha.value || 0.0; var rgbParams = [red, green, blue].join(','); return ['rgba(', rgbParams, ',', alphaFrac, ')'].join(''); }; var rgbToCssColor = function(red, green, blue) { var rgbNumber = new Number((red << 16) | (green << 8) | blue); var hexString = rgbNumber.toString(16); var missingZeros = 6 - hexString.length; var resultBuilder = ['#']; for (var i = 0; i < missingZeros; i++) { resultBuilder.push('0'); } resultBuilder.push(hexString); return resultBuilder.join(''); }; // ..."

This uses a wrapper message rather than a simple float scalar so that it is possible to distinguish between a default value and the value being unset.

Existing data will be shifted down or right (depending on the dimension) to make room for the moved dimensions. The source dimensions are removed from the grid, so the the data may end up in a different index than specified. For example, given `A1..A5` of `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` and wanting to move `"1"` and `"2"` to between `"3"` and `"4"`, the source would be `ROWS [1..3)`,and the destination index would be `"4"` (the zero-based index of row 5). The end result would be `A1..A5` of `0, 3, 1, 2, 4`.

For example, if the source data has columns named "Revenue" and "Cost" and a condition is applied to the "Revenue" column with type `NUMBER_GREATER` and value `=Cost`, then only columns where "Revenue" > "Cost" are included.

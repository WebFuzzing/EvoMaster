            * `allUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone who is
               on the internet; with or without a Google account.

            * `allAuthenticatedUsers`: A special identifier that represents anyone
               who is authenticated with a Google account or a service account.

            * `user:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a specific Google
               account. For example, `alice@example.com` .


            * `serviceAccount:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a service
               account. For example, `my-other-app@appspot.gserviceaccount.com`.

            * `group:{emailid}`: An email address that represents a Google group.
               For example, `admins@example.com`.

            * `deleted:user:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
               identifier) representing a user that has been recently deleted. For
               example, `alice@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If the user is
               recovered, this value reverts to `user:{emailid}` and the recovered user
               retains the role in the binding.

               If the service account is undeleted, this value reverts to
               `serviceAccount:{emailid}` and the undeleted service account retains the
               role in the binding.

            * `deleted:group:{emailid}?uid={uniqueid}`: An email address (plus unique
               identifier) representing a Google group that has been recently
               deleted. For example, `admins@example.com?uid=123456789012345678901`. If
               the group is recovered, this value reverts to `group:{emailid}` and the
               recovered group retains the role in the binding.

    GoogleIamV1__Policy:
      description: >-
        An Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy, which specifies access

        controls for Google Cloud resources.



        A `Policy` is a collection of `bindings`. A `binding` binds one or more

        `members` to a single `role`. Members can be user accounts, service accounts,

        Google groups, and domains (such as G Suite). A `role` is a named list of

        permissions; each `role` can be an IAM predefined role or a user-created

        custom role.


        Optionally, a `binding` can specify a `condition`, which is a logical

        expression that allows access to a resource only if the expression evaluates

        to `true`. A condition can add constraints based on attributes of the

        request, the resource, or both.


        **JSON example:**

            {
              "bindings": [
                {
                  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
                  "members": [
                    "user:mike@example.com",
                    "group:admins@example.com",
                    "domain:google.com",
                    "serviceAccount:my-project-id@appspot.gserviceaccount.com"
                  ]
                },
                {
                  "role": "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
                  "members": ["user:eve@example.com"],
                  "condition": {
                    "title": "expirable access",
                    "description": "Does not grant access after Sep 2020",
                    "expression": "request.time < timestamp('2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z')",
                  }
                }

              "etag": "BwWWja0YfJA=",
              "version": 3
            }

        **YAML example:**

            bindings:
            - members:
              - user:mike@example.com
              - group:admins@example.com

              - user:eve@example.com
              role: roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer
              condition:

        etag:
          description: >-
            `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help

            prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other.

            It is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the

            read-modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race

            conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and

            systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy` to

            ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the policy.


            **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

            whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

            you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
          format: byte
          type: string
        version:

            Valid values are `0`, `1`, and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value

            are rejected.


            Any operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version

            `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:


            * Getting a policy that includes a conditional role binding

            * Adding a conditional role binding to a policy

            * Changing a conditional role binding in a policy

            * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a policy
              that includes conditions

            **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the `etag` field

            whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows

            you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of

            the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.


            If a policy does not include any conditions, operations on that policy may

            specify any valid version or leave the field unset.

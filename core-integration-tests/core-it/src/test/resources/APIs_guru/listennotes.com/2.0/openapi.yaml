            Please note that podcasts that are "best" in a country/region may not be produced in that country/region.
            For example, a podcast from the US may be very popular in Canada.
            You can get the supported country codes (e.g., us, jp, gb...) from `GET /regions`.
            If not specified, you'll get "best podcasts" in United States.

            This is to narrow down the results to include "best podcasts" produced in a specific country/region.

            If not specified, you'll get "best podcasts" produced in any country/region.
            If you want to get a country/region's "best podcasts" that are also produced in that country/region,
            then you need to specify both **region** and **publisher_region**,
            e.g., `region=jp` and `publisher_region=jp`.

    The Hosted onboarding API provides endpoints that you can use to generate links to Adyen-hosted pages, such as an [onboarding page](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/hosted-onboarding-page) or a [PCI compliance questionnaire](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms/platforms-for-partners). Then you can provide the link to your account holder so they can complete their onboarding.

    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Hosted onboarding API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact our [Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use your credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    When going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The Hosted onboarding API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Hop/v5/getOnboardingUrl
    ```

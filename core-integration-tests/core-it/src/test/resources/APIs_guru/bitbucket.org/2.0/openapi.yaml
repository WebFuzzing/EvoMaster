      Repository owners and administrators can set branch management
      rules on a repository that control what can be pushed by whom.
      Through these rules, you can enforce a project or team
      workflow. For example, owners or administrators can:

      * Limit push powers
      * Prevent branch deletion
      * Prevent history re-writes (Git only)
    name: Branch restrictions
  - description: |
      The branching model resource is used to modify the branching model
      for a repository.

      You can use the branching model to define a branch based workflow
      for your repositories. When you map your workflow to branch types,
      you can ensure that branches are named consistently by configuring
      which branch types to make available.

      Teams are deploying code faster than ever, thanks to continuous
      delivery practices and tools like Bitbucket Pipelines. Bitbucket
      Deployments gives teams visibility into their deployment
      environments and helps teams to track how far changes have
      progressed in their deployment pipeline.

      The issue resources provide functionality for getting information on
      issues in an issue tracker, creating new issues, updating them and deleting
      them.

      You can access public issues without authentication, but you can't gain access
      to private repositories' issues. By authenticating, you will get the ability
      to create issues, as well as access to updating data or deleting issues you
      have access to.

      Pull requests are a feature that makes it easier for developers
      to collaborate using Bitbucket. They provide a user-friendly web
      interface for discussing proposed changes before integrating them
      into the official project.
    name: Pullrequests

      The refs resource allows you access branches and tags in a repository.
      By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control
      system returns them and identical to the ordering one sees when running
      "$ git show-ref". Note that this follows simple lexical ordering of the
       ref names.

      Code insights provides reports, annotations, and metrics to help you
      and your team improve code quality in pull requests throughout the code
      review process. Some of the available code insights are static analysis
      reports, security scan results, artifact links, unit tests, and build
      status.

      A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It
      allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access
      when needed. The repo resource allows you to access public repos,
      or repos that belong to a specific workspace.
    name: Repositories
  - description: |
      Snippets allow you share code segments or files with yourself, members of
      your workspace, or the world.

      Like pull requests, repositories and workspaces, the full set of snippets
      is defined by what the current user has access to. This includes all
      snippets owned by any of the workspaces the user is a member of, or
      snippets by other users that the current user is either watching or has
       collaborated on (for instance by commenting on it).

      The teams resource has been deprecated, and the workspaces

      The teams resource returns all the teams that the authenticated
      user is associated with.
    name: Teams
  - description: |
      The users resource allows you to access public information
      associated with a user account. Most resources in the users
      endpoint have been deprecated in favor of workspaces.

      Webhooks provide a way to configure Bitbucket Cloud to make requests to
      your server (or another external service) whenever certain events occur in
      Bitbucket Cloud.

      A webhook consists of:

      * A subject -- The resource that generates the events. Currently, this resource
      is the repository, user account, or team where you create the webhook.
      * One or more event -- The default event is a repository push, but you can
      select multiple events that can trigger the webhook.
      * A URL -- The endpoint where you want Bitbucket to send the event payloads
      when a matching event happens.

      There are two parts to getting a webhook to work: creating the webhook and
      triggering the webhook. After you create a webhook for an event, every time
      that event occurs, Bitbucket sends a payload request that describes the event
      to the specified URL. Thus, you can think of webhooks as a kind of
      notification system.

      Use webhooks to integrate applications with Bitbucket Cloud. The following
      use cases provides examples of when you would want to use webhooks:

      * Every time a user pushes commits in a repository, you may want to notify
      your CI server to start a build.
      * Every time a user pushes commits or creates a pull request, you may want to
      display a notification in your application.

        Creates a new repository.

        Note: In order to set the project for the newly created repository,
        pass in either the project key or the project UUID as part of the
        request body as shown in the examples below:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "MARS"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        or

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
            "scm": "git",
            "project": {
                "key": "{ba516952-992a-4c2d-acbd-17d502922f96}"
            }
        }' https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/teamsinspace/hablanding
        ```

        The project must be assigned for all repositories. If the project is not provided,
        the repository is automatically assigned to the oldest project in the workspace.

        Note: In the examples above, the workspace ID `teamsinspace`,
        and/or the repository name `hablanding` can be replaced by UUIDs.

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        repository, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the repository endpoint for an example
        of the request body.

        ### Update

        Note: Changing the `name` of the repository will cause the location to
        be changed. This is because the URL of the repo is derived from the
        name (a process called slugification). In such a scenario, it is
        possible for the request to fail if the newly created slug conflicts
        with an existing repository's slug. But if there is no conflict,
        the new location will be returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        Creates a new branch restriction rule for a repository.

        `kind` describes what will be restricted. Allowed values include:
        `push`, `force`, `delete` and `restrict_merges`.

        Different kinds of branch restrictions have different requirements:

        * `push` and `restrict_merges` require `users` and `groups` to be
          specified. Empty lists are allowed, in which case permission is
          denied for everybody.

        The restriction applies to all branches that match. There are
        two ways to match a branch. It is configured in `branch_match_kind`:

        1. `glob`: Matches a branch against the `pattern`. A `'*'` in
           `pattern` will expand to match zero or more characters, and every
           other character matches itself. For example, `'foo*'` will match
           `'foo'` and `'foobar'`, but not `'barfoo'`. `'*'` will match all
           branches.
        2. `branching_model`: Matches a branch against the repository's
           branching model. The `branch_type` controls the type of branch
           to match. Allowed values include: `production`, `development`,
           `bugfix`, `release`, `feature` and `hotfix`.

        The combination of `kind` and match must be unique. This means that
        two `glob` restrictions in a repository cannot have the same `kind` and
        `pattern`. Additionally, two `branching_model` restrictions in a
        repository cannot have the same `kind` and `branch_type`.

        `users` and `groups` are lists of users and groups that are except from
        the restriction. They can only be configured in `push` and
        `restrict_merges` restrictions. The `push` restriction stops a user
        pushing to matching branches unless that user is in `users` or is a
        member of a group in `groups`. The `restrict_merges` stops a user
        merging pull requests to matching branches unless that user is in
        `users` or is a member of a group in `groups`. Adding new users or
        groups to an existing restriction should be done via `PUT`.

        Note that branch restrictions with overlapping matchers is allowed,
        but the resulting behavior may be surprising.

        Return the branching model configuration for a repository. The returned
        object:

        1. Always has a `development` property for the development branch.
        2. Always a `production` property for the production branch. The
           production branch can be disabled.
        3. The `branch_types` contains all the branch types.

        This is the raw configuration for the branching model. A client
        wishing to see the branching model with its actual current branches may
        find the [active model API](../branching-model#get) more useful.

        Update the branching model configuration for a repository.

        The `development` branch can be configured to a specific branch or to
        track the main branch. When set to a specific branch it must
        currently exist. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `development` property will leave the development branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `development` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. It is
        not possible to update the settings for `development` if that
        would leave the branch in an invalid state. Such a request will be
        rejected.

        The `production` branch can be a specific branch, the main
        branch or disabled. When set to a specific branch it must currently
        exist. The `enabled` property can be used to enable (`true`) or
        disable (`false`) it. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. A request without a
        `production` property will leave the production branch unchanged.

        It is possible for the `production` branch to be invalid. This
        happens when it points at a specific branch that has been
        deleted. This is indicated in the `is_valid` field for the branch. A
        request that would leave `production` enabled and invalid will be
        rejected. It is possible to update `production` and make it invalid if
        it would also be left disabled.

        The `branch_types` property contains the branch types to be updated.
        Only the branch types passed will be updated. All updates will be
        rejected if it would leave the branching model in an invalid state.
        For branch types this means that:

        1. The prefixes for all enabled branch types are valid. For example,
           it is not possible to use '*' inside a Git prefix.
        2. A prefix of an enabled branch type must not be a prefix of another
           enabled branch type. This is to ensure that a branch can be easily
           classified by its prefix unambiguously.

        It is possible to store an invalid prefix if that branch type would be
        left disabled. Only the passed properties will be updated. The
        properties not passed will be left unchanged. Each branch type must
        have a `kind` property to identify it.

        To upload a report, make sure to generate an ID that is unique across all reports for that commit. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-001.

        Bulk upload of annotations.
        Annotations are individual findings that have been identified as part of a report, for example, a line of code that represents a vulnerability. These annotations can be attached to a specific file and even a specific line in that file, however, that is optional. Annotations are not mandatory and a report can contain up to 1000 annotations.

        Add the annotations you want to upload as objects in a JSON array and make sure each annotation has the external_id field set to a unique value. If you want to use an existing id from your own system, we recommend prefixing it with your system's name to avoid collisions, for example, mySystem-annotation001. The external id can later be used to identify the report as an alternative to the generated [UUID](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/api/2/reference/meta/uri-uuid#uuid). You can upload up to 100 annotations per POST request.

        Creates a new build status against the specified commit.

        If the specified key already exists, the existing status object will
        be overwritten.

        Example:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo/commit/e10dae226959c2194f2b07b077c07762d93821cf/statuses/build/           -X POST -u jdoe -H 'Content-Type: application/json'           -d '{
            "key": "MY-BUILD",
            "state": "SUCCESSFUL",
            "description": "42 tests passed",
            "url": "https://www.example.org/my-build-result"
          }'
        ```

        When creating a new commit status, you can use a URI template for the URL.
        Templates are URLs that contain variable names that Bitbucket will
        evaluate at runtime whenever the URL is displayed anywhere similar to
        parameter substitution in
        [Bitbucket Connect](https://developer.atlassian.com/bitbucket/concepts/context-parameters.html).
        For example, one could use `https://foo.com/builds/{repository.full_name}`
        which Bitbucket will turn into `https://foo.com/builds/foo/bar` at render time.
        The context variables available are `repository` and `commit`.

        These are the repository's commits. They are paginated and returned
        in reverse chronological order, similar to the output of `git log`.
        Like these tools, the DAG can be filtered.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/

        Returns all commits in the repo in topological order (newest commit
        first). All branches and tags are included (similar to
        `git log --all`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?exclude=master

        Returns all commits in the repo that are not on master
        (similar to `git log --all ^master`).

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?include=foo&include=bar&exclude=fu&exclude=fubar

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `fu` or
        `fubar` (similar to `git log foo bar ^fu ^fubar`).

        An optional `path` parameter can be specified that will limit the
        results to commits that affect that path. `path` can either be a file
        or a directory. If a directory is specified, commits are returned that
        have modified any file in the directory tree rooted by `path`. It is
        important to note that if the `path` parameter is specified, the commits
        returned by this endpoint may no longer be a DAG, parent commits that
        do not modify the path will be omitted from the response.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=README.md&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed the file README.md.

        ## GET /repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/commits/?path=src/&include=foo&include=bar&exclude=master

        Returns all commits that are on refs `foo` or `bar`, but not on `master`
        that changed to a file in any file in the directory src or its children.

        Because the response could include a very large number of commits, it
        is paginated. Follow the 'next' link in the response to navigate to the
        next page of commits. As with other paginated resources, do not
        construct your own links.

        When the include and exclude parameters are more than can fit in a
        query string, clients can use a `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST instead.

        Produces a raw git-style diff.

        #### Single commit spec

        If the `spec` argument to this API is a single commit, the diff is
        produced against the first parent of the specified commit.

        #### Two commit spec

        Two commits separated by `..` may be provided as the `spec`, e.g.,
        `3a8b42..9ff173`. When two commits are provided and the `merge` query
        parameter is true or absent, this API produces a 3-way diff, also
        referred to as a merge diff. This is equivalent to merging the left
        branch into the right branch and then computing the diff of the merge
        commit against its first parent (the right branch). These diffs have
        the same behavior as pull requests that show the 3-way diff, such as
        the [Bitbucket Cloud Pull
        Request](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/a-better-pull-request/).
        For a simple git-style diff, add `merge=false` to the query.

        The two commits are interpreted as follows:

        * First commit: the commit containing the changes we wish to preview
        * Second commit: the commit representing the state to which we want to
          compare the first commit
        * **Note**: This is the opposite of the order used in `git diff`.

        #### Comparison to patches

        While similar to patches, diffs:

        * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
          the diff to just that one file diff

        #### Response

        The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

            a simple 'two dot' diff between the source and
            destination is returned. True if omitted.

            If the diff was too large and timed out.

            Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
            instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
            trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
            like these, a 555 status code is returned.

    get:
      description: |-
        Returns a paginated list of commits that modified the specified file.

        Commits are returned in reverse chronological order. This is roughly
        equivalent to the following commands:

            $ git log --follow --date-order <sha> <path>

            $ hg log --follow <path>

        By default, Bitbucket will follow renames and the path name in the
        returned entries reflects that. This can be turned off using the
        `?renames=false` query parameter.

        Results are returned in descending chronological order by default, and
        like most endpoints you can
        [filter and sort](../../../../../../meta/filtering) the response to
        only provide exactly the data you want.

        For example, if you wanted to find commits made before 2011-05-18
        against a file named `README.rst`, but you only wanted the path and
        date, your query would look like this:

        ```
        $ curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/dogslow/filehistory/master/README.rst'\
          '?fields=values.next,values.path,values.commit.date&q=commit.date<=2011-05-18'
        {
          "values": [
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-17T07:32:09+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.rst"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:33:28+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            },
            {
              "commit": {
                "date": "2011-05-16T06:15:39+00:00"
              },
              "path": "README.txt"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        In the response you can see that the file was renamed to `README.rst`
        by the commit made on 2011-05-16, and was previously named `README.txt`.

        Creates a new fork of the specified repository.

        ## Forking a repository

        To create a fork, specify the workspace explicitly as part of the
        request body:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -u jdoe https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/forks \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
            "name": "bbql_fork",
            "workspace": {
              "slug": "atlassian"
            }
        }'
        ```

        To fork a repository into the same workspace, also specify a new `name`.

        When you specify a value for `name`, it will also affect the `slug`.
        The `slug` is reflected in the repository URL of the new fork. It is
        derived from `name` by substituting non-ASCII characters, removes
        whitespace, and changes characters to lower case. For example,
        `My repo` would turn into `my_repo`.

        You need contributor access to create new forks within a workspace.


        ## Change the properties of a new fork

        By default the fork inherits most of its properties from the parent.
        However, since the optional POST body document follows the normal
        `repository` JSON schema and you can override the new fork's
        properties.

        Properties that can be overridden include:

        * description
        * fork_policy
        * language
        * mainbranch
        * is_private (note that a private repo's fork_policy might prohibit
          the creation of public forks, in which `is_private=False` would fail)
        * has_issues (to initialize or disable the new repo's issue tracker --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's issue
          tracker are not copied during forking)
        * has_wiki (to initialize or disable the new repo's wiki --
          note that the actual contents of the parent repository's wiki are not
          copied during forking)
        * project (when forking into a private project, the fork's `is_private`
          must be `true`)

        Properties that cannot be modified include:

        * scm
        * parent
        * full_name

        Example:

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -u credentials -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/my-repo-slug/hooks

        Note that this call requires the webhook scope, as well as any scope
        that applies to the events that the webhook subscribes to. In the
        example above that means: `webhook`, `repository` and `issue`.

        Also note that the `url` must properly resolve and cannot be an
        internal, non-routed address.

        This endpoint is used to poll for the progress of an issue export
        job and return the zip file after the job is complete.
        As long as the job is running, this will return a 200 response
        with in the response body a description of the current status.

        After the job has been scheduled, but before it starts executing, this

        change record is created under the `/issues/123/changes` endpoint. It

        returns a redirect pointing to the actual file that in turn will return

        Returns the list of all changes that have been made to the specified

        Each time an issue is edited in the UI or through the API, an immutable
        change record is created under the `/issues/123/changes` endpoint. It
        also has a comment associated with the change.

        Note that this operation is changing significantly, due to privacy changes.

        Changes support [filtering and sorting](../../../meta/filtering) that
        can be used to search for specific changes. For instance, to see
        when an issue transitioned to "resolved":

        ```
        $ curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/site/master/issues/1/changes \
           -G --data-urlencode='q=changes.state.new = "resolved"'
        ```

        This resource is only available on repositories that have the issue
        tracker enabled.

        N.B.

        The `changes.assignee` and `changes.assignee_account_id` fields are not
        a `user` object. Instead, they contain the raw `username` and
        `account_id` of the user. This is to protect the integrity of the audit
        log even after a user account gets deleted.

        The `changes.assignee` field is deprecated will disappear in the
        future. Use `changes.assignee_account_id` instead.

        Makes a change to the specified issue.

        For example, to change an issue's state and assignee, create a new
        change object that modifies these fields:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/site/master/issues/1234/changes \
          -s -u evzijst -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{
            "changes": {
              "assignee_account_id": {
                "new": "557058:c0b72ad0-1cb5-4018-9cdc-0cde8492c443"
              },
              "state": {
                "new": 'resolved"
              }
            }
            "message": {
              "raw": "This is now resolved."
            }
          }'
        ```

        The above example also includes a custom comment to go alongside the
        change. This comment will also be visible on the issue page in the UI.

        The fields of the `changes` object are strings, not objects. This
        allows for immutable change log records, even after user accounts,
        milestones, or other objects recorded in a change entry, get renamed or
        deleted.

        The `assignee_account_id` field stores the account id. When POSTing a
        new change and changing the assignee, the client should therefore use
        the user's account_id in the `changes.assignee_account_id.new` field.

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories or private
        issue trackers require the caller to authenticate with an account that
        has appropriate authorization.

        Produces a raw patch for a single commit (diffed against its first

        `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
        second commit the destination).

        In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a patch series is returned
        for the commits on the source branch (`3a8b42` and its ancestors in
        our example). For Mercurial, a single patch is returned that combines
        the changes of all commits on the source branch.

        While similar to diffs, patches:

        * Have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
        * Do not support the `path=foo/bar.py` query parameter

        The raw patch is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
        repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
        content-type is `text/plain`.

            Since this endpoint does not employ any form of pagination, but
            instead returns the diff as a single document, it can run into
            trouble on very large diffs. If Bitbucket times out in cases
            like these, a 555 status code is returned.

        Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline.
        There are a couple of different options to initiate a pipeline, where the payload of the request will determine which type of pipeline will be instantiated.
        # Trigger a Pipeline for a branch
        One way to trigger pipelines is by specifying the branch for which you want to trigger a pipeline.
        The specified branch will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will then do a clone of the repository and checkout the latest revision of the specified branch.

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```
        # Trigger a Pipeline for a commit on a branch or tag
        You can initiate a pipeline for a specific commit and in the context of a specified reference (e.g. a branch, tag or bookmark).
        The specified reference will be used to determine which pipeline definition from the bitbucket-pipelines.yml file will be applied to initiate the pipeline. The pipeline will clone the repository and then do a checkout the specified reference.

        The following reference types are supported:

        * `branch`
        * `named_branch`
        * `bookmark`
         * `tag`

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
          https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
          -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "ce5b7431602f7cbba007062eeb55225c6e18e956"
              },
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_name": "master"
            }
          }'
        ```
        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit
        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit.
        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository and checkout the specified revision.

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
                "selector": {
                   "type":"custom",
                      "pattern":"Deploy to production"
                  },
                "type":"pipeline_commit_target"
           }
          }'
        ```
        # Trigger a specific pipeline definition for a commit on a branch or tag
        You can trigger a specific pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file for a specific commit in the context of a specified reference.
        In addition to the commit revision, you specify the type and pattern of the selector that identifies the pipeline definition, as well as the reference information. The resulting pipeline will then clone the repository a checkout the specified reference.

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/jeroendr/meat-demo2/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
             "target": {
              "commit": {
                 "hash":"a3c4e02c9a3755eccdc3764e6ea13facdf30f923",
                 "type":"commit"
               },
               "selector": {
                  "type": "custom",
                  "pattern": "Deploy to production"
               },
               "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
               "ref_name": "master",
               "ref_type": "branch"
             }
          }'
        ```


        # Trigger a custom pipeline with variables
        In addition to triggering a custom pipeline that is defined in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file as shown in the examples above, you can specify variables that will be available for your build. In the request, provide a list of variables, specifying the following for each variable: key, value, and whether it should be secured or not (this field is optional and defaults to not secured).

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
            "target": {
              "type": "pipeline_ref_target",
              "ref_type": "branch",
              "ref_name": "master",
              "selector": {
                "type": "custom",
                "pattern": "Deploy to production"
              }
            },
            "variables": [
              {
                "key": "var1key",
                "value": "var1value",
                "secured": true
              },
              {
                "key": "var2key",
                "value": "var2value"
              }
            ]
          }'
        ```

        # Trigger a pull request pipeline

        You can also initiate a pipeline for a specific pull request.

        ### Example

        ```
        $ curl -X POST -is -u username:password \
          -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
         https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{repo_slug}/pipelines/ \
         -d '
          {
        	"target": {
              "type": "pipeline_pullrequest_target",
        	  "source": "pull-request-branch",
              "destination": "master",
              "destination_commit": {
              	 "hash" : "9f848b7"
              },
              "commit": {
              	"hash" : "1a372fc"
              },
              "pullrequest" : {

        Creates a new pull request where the destination repository is
        this repository and the author is the authenticated user.

        The minimum required fields to create a pull request are `title` and
        `source`, specified by a branch name.

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-username/my-repository/pullrequests \
            -u my-username:my-password \
            --request POST \
            --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            --data '{
                "title": "My Title",
                "source": {
                    "branch": {
                        "name": "staging"
                    }
                }
            }'
        ```

        If the pull request's `destination` is not specified, it will default
        to the `repository.mainbranch`. To open a pull request to a
        different branch, say from a feature branch to a staging branch,
        specify a `destination` (same format as the `source`):

        ```
        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },
            "destination": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "staging"
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        Reviewers can be specified by adding an array of user objects as the
        `reviewers` property.

        ```
        {
            "title": "My Title",
            "source": {
                "branch": {
                    "name": "my-feature-branch"
                }
            },
            "reviewers": [
                {
                    "uuid": "{504c3b62-8120-4f0c-a7bc-87800b9d6f70}"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```

        Other fields:

        * `description` - a string
        * `close_source_branch` - boolean that specifies if the source branch should be closed upon merging

          The new pull request.

          The request URL you POST to becomes the destination repository URL. For this reason, you must specify an explicit source repository in the request object if you want to pull from a different repository (fork).

          Since not all elements are required or even mutable, you only need to include the elements you want to initialize, such as the source branch and the title.

        Returns a paginated list of the pull request's activity log.

        This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20 endpoint
        returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request changes. The internal
        endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.

        Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline property.

        Returns a paginated list of the pull request's activity log.

        This handler serves both a v20 and internal endpoint. The v20 endpoint
        returns reviewer comments, updates, approvals and request changes. The internal
        endpoint includes those plus tasks and attachments.

        Comments created on a file or a line of code have an inline property.

        When merging a pull request takes too long, the client receives a
        task ID along with a 202 status code. The task ID can be used in a call
        to this endpoint to check the status of a merge task.

        ```
        curl -X GET https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bitbucket/pullrequests/2286/merge/task-status/<task_id>
        ```

        If the merge task is not yet finished, a PENDING status will be returned.

        ```
        HTTP/2 200
        {
            "task_status": "PENDING",
            "links": {

                }
            }
        }
        ```

        If the merge was successful, a SUCCESS status will be returned.

        ```
        HTTP/2 200

            "task_status": "SUCCESS",

            "merge_result": <the merged pull request object>

        If the merge task failed, an error will be returned.

        Returns the branches and tags in the repository.

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
        the ordering one sees when running "$ git show-ref". Note that this follows simple
        lexical ordering of the ref names.

        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that refs are
        sorted ["branch1", "branch10", "branch2", "v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["branch1", "branch2",
        "branch10", "v9", "v10", "v11"].

        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

            field is handled specially for refs in that, if specified as the sort field, it
            uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,
            it will return ['1.1', '1.2', '1.10'] instead of ['1.1', '1.10', '1.2'].

                Branches support [filtering and sorting](../../../../../meta/filtering)
                that can be used to search for specific branches. For instance, to find
                all branches that have "stab" in their name:

                ```
                curl -s https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/aui/refs/branches -G --data-urlencode 'q=name ~ "stab"'
                ```

                By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
                the ordering one sees when running "$ hg branches" or "$ git branch --list". Note that this follows simple
                lexical ordering of the ref names.

                This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are
                sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].

                Sorting can be changed using the ?q= query parameter. When using ?q=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
                Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

            field is handled specially for branches in that, if specified as the sort field, it
            uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,

        Creates a new branch in the specified repository.

        The payload of the POST should consist of a JSON document that
        contains the name of the tag and the target hash.

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/seanfarley/hg/refs/branches \
        -s -u seanfarley -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \

            }
        }'
        ```

        This call requires authentication. Private repositories require the
        caller to authenticate with an account that has appropriate
        authorization.

        The branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.
        refs/heads). This endpoint does support using short hash prefixes for
        the commit hash, but it may return a 400 response if the provided
        prefix is ambiguous. Using a full commit hash is the preferred
        approach.

                For Git, the branch name should not include any prefixes (e.g.

        Returns the tags in the repository.

        By default, results will be in the order the underlying source control system returns them and identical to
        the ordering one sees when running "$ hg tags" or "$ git tag --list". Note that this follows simple
        lexical ordering of the ref names.

        This can be undesirable as it does apply any natural sorting semantics, meaning for instance that tags are
        sorted ["v10", "v11", "v9"] instead of ["v9", "v10", "v11"].

        Sorting can be changed using the ?sort= query parameter. When using ?sort=name to explicitly sort on ref name,
        Bitbucket will apply natural sorting and interpret numerical values as numbers instead of strings.

            field is handled specially for tags in that, if specified as the sort field, it
            uses a natural sort order instead of the default lexicographical sort order. For example,
            it will return ['1.1', '1.2', '1.10'] instead of ['1.1', '1.10', '1.2'].

        This endpoint is used to create new commits in the repository by
        uploading files.

        To add a new file to a repository:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F /repo/path/to/image.png=@image.png
        ```

        This will create a new commit on top of the main branch, inheriting the
        contents of the main branch, but adding (or overwriting) the
        `image.png` file to the repository in the `/repo/path/to` directory.

        To create a commit that deletes files, use the `files` parameter:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/username/slug/src \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/1.txt \
          -F files=/file/to/delete/2.txt
        ```

        You can add/modify/delete multiple files in a request. Rename/move a
        file by deleting the old path and adding the content at the new path.

        This endpoint accepts `multipart/form-data` (as in the examples above),
        as well as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.

        ## multipart/form-data

        A `multipart/form-data` post contains a series of "form fields" that
        identify both the individual files that are being uploaded, as well as
        additional, optional meta data.

        Files are uploaded in file form fields (those that have a
        `Content-Disposition` parameter) whose field names point to the remote
        path in the repository where the file should be stored. Path field
        names are always interpreted to be absolute from the root of the
        repository, regardless whether the client uses a leading slash (as the
        above `curl` example did).

        File contents are treated as bytes and are not decoded as text.

        The commit message, as well as other non-file meta data for the
        request, is sent along as normal form field elements. Meta data fields
        share the same namespace as the file objects. For `multipart/form-data`
        bodies that should not lead to any ambiguity, as the
        `Content-Disposition` header will contain the `filename` parameter to
        distinguish between a file named "message" and the commit message field.

        ## application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        It is also possible to upload new files using a simple
        `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` POST. This can be convenient when
        uploading pure text files:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src \
          --data-urlencode "/path/to/me.txt=Lorem ipsum." \
          --data-urlencode "message=Initial commit" \
          --data-urlencode "author=Erik van Zijst <erik.van.zijst@gmail.com>"
        ```

        There could be a field name clash if a client were to upload a file
        named "message", as this filename clashes with the meta data property
        for the commit message. To avoid this and to upload files whose names
        clash with the meta data properties, use a leading slash for the files,
        e.g. `curl --data-urlencode "/message=file contents"`.

        When an explicit slash is omitted for a file whose path matches that of
        a meta data parameter, then it is interpreted as meta data, not as a
        file.

        ## Executables and links

        While this API aims to facilitate the most common use cases, it is
        possible to perform some more advanced operations like creating a new
        symlink in the repository, or creating an executable file.

        Files can be supplied with a `x-attributes` value in the
        `Content-Disposition` header. For example, to upload an executable
        file, as well as create a symlink from `README.txt` to `README`:

        ```
        --===============1438169132528273974==
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
        Content-ID: "bin/shutdown.sh"
        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="shutdown.sh"; x-attributes:"executable"

        #!/bin/sh
        halt

        --===============1438169132528273974==
        Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"
        MIME-Version: 1.0
        Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
        Content-ID: "/README.txt"
        Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="README.txt"; x-attributes:"link"

        README
        --===============1438169132528273974==--
        ```

        Links are files that contain the target path and have
        `x-attributes:"link"` set.

        When overwriting links with files, or vice versa, the newly uploaded
        file determines both the new contents, as well as the attributes. That
        means uploading a file without specifying `x-attributes="link"` will
        create a regular file, even if the parent commit hosted a symlink at
        the same path.

        The same applies to executables. When modifying an existing executable
        file, the form-data file element must include
        `x-attributes="executable"` in order to preserve the executable status
        of the file.

        Note that this API does not support the creation or manipulation of
        subrepos / submodules.

            Optional field that declares the files that the request is
            manipulating. When adding a new file to a repo, or when
            overwriting an existing file, the client can just upload
            the full contents of the file in a normal form field and
            the use of this `files` meta data field is redundant.
            However, when the `files` field contains a file path that
            does not have a corresponding, identically-named form
            field, then Bitbucket interprets that as the client wanting
            to replace the named file with the null set and the file is
            deleted instead.

            Paths in the repo that are referenced in neither files nor
            an individual file field, remain unchanged and carry over
            from the parent to the new commit.

            This API does not support renaming as an explicit feature.
            To rename a file, simply delete it and recreate it under
            the new name in the same commit.
          in: query
          name: files
          required: false

            The name of the branch that the new commit should be
            created on. When omitted, the commit will be created on top
            of the main branch and will become the main branch's new
            head.

            When a branch name is provided that already exists in the
            repo, then the commit will be created on top of that
            branch. In this case, *if* a parent SHA1 was also provided,
            then it is asserted that the parent is the branch's
            tip/HEAD at the time the request is made. When this is not
            the case, a 409 is returned.

            When a new branch name is specified (that does not already
            exist in the repo), and no parent SHA1s are provided, then
            the new commit will inherit from the current main branch's
            tip/HEAD commit, but not advance the main branch. The new
            commit will be the new branch. When the request *also*
            specifies a parent SHA1, then the new commit and branch
            are created directly on top of the parent commit,
            regardless of the state of the main branch.

            When a branch name is not specified, but a parent SHA1 is
            provided, then Bitbucket asserts that it represents the
            main branch's current HEAD/tip, or a 409 is returned.

            When a branch name is not specified and the repo is empty,
            the new commit will become the repo's root commit and will
            be on the main branch.

            When a branch name is specified and the repo is empty, the
            new commit will become the repo's root commit and also
            define the repo's main branch going forward.

            This API cannot be used to create additional root commits
            in non-empty repos.

            The branch field cannot be repeated.

            As a side effect, this API can be used to create a new
            branch without modifying any files, by specifying a new
            branch name in this field, together with `parents`, but
            omitting the `files` fields, while not sending any files.
            This will create a new commit and branch with the same
            contents as the first parent. The diff of this commit
            against its first parent will be empty.

    get:
      description: |-
        This endpoints is used to retrieve the contents of a single file,
        or the contents of a directory at a specified revision.

        ## Raw file contents

        When `path` points to a file, this endpoint returns the raw contents.
        The response's Content-Type is derived from the filename
        extension (not from the contents). The file contents are not processed
        and no character encoding/recoding is performed and as a result no
        character encoding is included as part of the Content-Type.

        The `Content-Disposition` header will be "attachment" to prevent
        browsers from running executable files.

        If the file is managed by LFS, then a 301 redirect pointing to
        Atlassian's media services platform is returned.

        The response includes an ETag that is based on the contents of the file
        and its attributes. This means that an empty `__init__.py` always
        returns the same ETag, regardless on the directory it lives in, or the
        commit it is on.

        ## File meta data

        When the request for a file path includes the query parameter
        `?format=meta`, instead of returning the file's raw contents, Bitbucket
        instead returns the JSON object describing the file's properties:

        ```javascript
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests/__init__.py?format=meta
        {
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/__init__.py?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "path": "tests/__init__.py",
          "commit": {
            "type": "commit",
            "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
            "links": {
              "self": {
                "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              },
              "html": {
                "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
              }
            }
          },
          "attributes": [],
          "type": "commit_file",
          "size": 0
        }
        ```

        File objects contain an `attributes` element that contains a list of
        possible modifiers. Currently defined values are:

        * `link` -- indicates that the entry is a symbolic link. The contents
            of the file represent the path the link points to.
        * `executable` -- indicates that the file has the executable bit set.
        * `subrepository` -- indicates that the entry points to a submodule or
            subrepo. The contents of the file is the SHA1 of the repository
            pointed to.
        * `binary` -- indicates whether Bitbucket thinks the file is binary.

        This endpoint can provide an alternative to how a HEAD request can be
        used to check for the existence of a file, or a file's size without
        incurring the overhead of receiving its full contents.


        ## Directory listings

        When `path` points to a directory instead of a file, the response is a
        paginated list of directory and file objects in the same order as the
        underlying SCM system would return them.

        For example:

        ```javascript
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef/tests
        {
          "pagelen": 10,
          "values": [
            {
              "path": "tests/test_project",
              "type": "commit_directory",
              "links": {
                "self": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
                },
                "meta": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
                }
              },
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
                "links": {
                  "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  },

                }
              },
              "path": "tests/__init__.py",
              "commit": {
                "type": "commit",
                "hash": "eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335",
                "links": {
                  "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/commit/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  },
                  "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/bbql/commits/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335"
                  }
                }
              },
              "attributes": [],
              "type": "commit_file",
              "size": 0
            }
          ],
          "page": 1,
          "size": 2
        }
        ```

        When listing the contents of the repo's root directory, the use of a
        trailing slash at the end of the URL is required.

        The response by default is not recursive, meaning that only the direct contents of
        a path are returned. The response does not recurse down into
        subdirectories. In order to "walk" the entire directory tree, the
        client can either parse each response and follow the `self` links of each
        `commit_directory` object, or can specify a `max_depth` to recurse to.

        The max_depth parameter will do a breadth-first search to return the contents of the subdirectories
        up to the depth specified. Breadth-first search was chosen as it leads to the least amount of
        file system operations for git. If the `max_depth` parameter is specified to be too
        large, the call will time out and return a 555.

        Each returned object is either a `commit_file`, or a `commit_directory`,
        both of which contain a `path` element. This path is the absolute path
        from the root of the repository. Each object also contains a `commit`
        object which embeds the commit the file is on. Note that this is merely
        the commit that was used in the URL. It is *not* the commit that last
        modified the file.

        Directory objects have 2 representations. Their `self` link returns the
        paginated contents of the directory. The `meta` link on the other hand
        returns the actual `directory` object itself, e.g.:

        ```javascript
        {
          "path": "tests/test_project",
          "type": "commit_directory",
          "links": {
            "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/"
            },
            "meta": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/atlassian/bbql/src/eefd5ef5d3df01aed629f650959d6706d54cd335/tests/test_project/?format=meta"
            }
          },
          "commit": { ... }
        }
        ```

        ## Querying, filtering and sorting

        Like most API endpoints, this API supports the Bitbucket
        querying/filtering syntax and so you could filter a directory listing
        to only include entries that match certain criteria. For instance, to
        list all binary files over 1kb use the expression:

        `size > 1024 and attributes = "binary"`

        which after urlencoding yields the query string:

        `?q=size%3E1024+and+attributes%3D%22binary%22`

        To change the ordering of the response, use the `?sort` parameter:

        `.../src/eefd5ef/?sort=-size`

        See [filtering and sorting](../../../../../../meta/filtering) for more
        details.
      parameters:
        - description: If 'meta' is provided, returns the (json) meta data for the contents of the file.  If 'rendered' is provided, returns the contents of a non-binary file in HTML-formatted rendered markup. Since Git does not generally track what text encoding scheme is used, this endpoint attempts to detect the most appropriate character encoding. While usually correct, determining the character encoding can be ambiguous which in exceptional cases can lead to misinterpretation of the characters. As such, the raw element in the response object should not be treated as equivalent to the file's actual contents.

        Returns all snippets. Like pull requests, repositories and workspaces, the
        full set of snippets is defined by what the current user has access to.

        This includes all snippets owned by any of the workspaces the user is a member of,
        or snippets by other users that the current user is either watching or has collaborated
        on (for instance by commenting on it).

        To limit the set of returned snippets, apply the
        `?role=[owner|contributor|member]` query parameter where the roles are
        defined as follows:

        * `owner`: all snippets owned by the current user
        * `contributor`: all snippets owned by, or watched by the current user
        * `member`: created in a workspaces or watched by the current user

        When no role is specified, all public snippets are returned, as well as all
        privately owned snippets watched or commented on.

        The returned response is a normal paginated JSON list. This endpoint
        only supports `application/json` responses and no
        `multipart/form-data` or `multipart/related`. As a result, it is not
        possible to include the file contents.

        Creates a new snippet under the authenticated user's account.

        Snippets can contain multiple files. Both text and binary files are
        supported.

        The simplest way to create a new snippet from a local file:

            $ curl -u username:password -X POST https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F file=@image.png

        Creating snippets through curl has a few limitations and so let's look
        at a more complicated scenario.

        Snippets are created with a multipart POST. Both `multipart/form-data`
        and `multipart/related` are supported. Both allow the creation of
        snippets with both meta data (title, etc), as well as multiple text
        and binary files.

        The main difference is that `multipart/related` can use rich encoding
        for the meta data (currently JSON).


        multipart/related (RFC-2387)
        ----------------------------

        This is the most advanced and efficient way to create a paste.

        The request contains multiple parts and is structured as follows.

        The first part is the JSON document that describes the snippet's
        properties or meta data. It either has to be the first part, or the
        request's `Content-Type` header must contain the `start` parameter to
        point to it.

        The remaining parts are the files of which there can be zero or more.
        Each file part should contain the `Content-ID` MIME header through
        which the JSON meta data's `files` element addresses it. The value
        should be the name of the file.

        `Content-Disposition` is an optional MIME header. The header's
        optional `filename` parameter can be used to specify the file name
        that Bitbucket should use when writing the file to disk. When present,
        `filename` takes precedence over the value of `Content-ID`.

        When the JSON body omits the `files` element, the remaining parts are
        not ignored. Instead, each file is added to the new snippet as if its
        name was explicitly linked (the use of the `files` elements is
        mandatory for some operations like deleting or renaming files).


        multipart/form-data
        -------------------

        The use of JSON for the snippet's meta data is optional. Meta data can
        also be supplied as regular form fields in a more conventional
        `multipart/form-data` request:

            $ curl -X POST -u credentials https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets               -F title="My snippet"               -F file=@foo.txt -F file=@image.png

            POST /2.0/snippets HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 951
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="image.png"
            Content-Type: application/octet-stream

            ?PNG

            IHDR?1??I.....
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f--

        Here the meta data properties are included as flat, top-level form
        fields. The file attachments use the `file` field name. To attach
        multiple files, simply repeat the field.

        The advantage of `multipart/form-data` over `multipart/related` is
        that it can be easier to build clients.

        Essentially all properties are optional, `title` and `files` included.


        Sharing and Visibility
        ----------------------

        Snippets can be either public (visible to anyone on Bitbucket, as well
        as anonymous users), or private (visible only to members of the workspace).
        This is controlled through the snippet's `is_private` element:

        * **is_private=false** -- everyone, including anonymous users can view
          the snippet
        * **is_private=true** -- only workspace members can view the snippet

        To create the snippet under a workspace, just append the workspace ID
        to the URL. See [`/2.0/snippets/{workspace}`](./snippets/%7Bworkspace%7D#post).

        Retrieves a single snippet.

        Snippets support multiple content types:

        * application/json
        * multipart/related
        * multipart/form-data


        application/json
        ----------------

        The default content type of the response is `application/json`.
        Since JSON is always `utf-8`, it cannot reliably contain file contents
        for files that are not text. Therefore, JSON snippet documents only
        contain the filename and links to the file contents.

        This means that in order to retrieve all parts of a snippet, N+1
        requests need to be made (where N is the number of files in the
        snippet).


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        To retrieve an entire snippet in a single response, use the
        `Accept: multipart/related` HTTP request header.

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/related" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/1

        multipart/form-data
        -------------------

        As with creating new snippets, `multipart/form-data` can be used as an
        alternative to `multipart/related`. However, the inherently flat
        structure of form-data means that only basic, root-level properties
        can be returned, while nested elements like `links` are omitted:

            $ curl -H "Accept: multipart/form-data" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj

        Response:

        Used to update a snippet. Use this to add and delete files and to
        change a snippet's title.

        To update a snippet, one can either PUT a full snapshot, or only the
        parts that need to be changed.

        The contract for PUT on this API is that properties missing from the
        request remain untouched so that snippets can be efficiently
        manipulated with differential payloads.

        To delete a property (e.g. the title, or a file), include its name in
        the request, but omit its value (use `null`).

        As in Git, explicit renaming of files is not supported. Instead, to
        rename a file, delete it and add it again under another name. This can
        be done atomically in a single request. Rename detection is left to
        the SCM.

        PUT supports three different content types for both request and
        response bodies:

        * `application/json`
        * `multipart/related`
        * `multipart/form-data`

        The content type used for the request body can be different than that
        used for the response. Content types are specified using standard HTTP
        headers.

        Use the `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers to select the desired
        request and response format.


        application/json
        ----------------

        As with creation and retrieval, the content type determines what
        properties can be manipulated. `application/json` does not support
        file contents and is therefore limited to a snippet's meta data.

        To update the title, without changing any of its files:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": "Updated title"}'


        To delete the title:

            $ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -d '{"title": null}'

        Not all parts of a snippet can be manipulated. The owner and creator
        for instance are immutable.


        multipart/related
        -----------------

        `multipart/related` can be used to manipulate all of a snippet's
        properties. The body is identical to a POST. properties omitted from
        the request are left unchanged. Since the `start` part contains JSON,
        the mechanism for manipulating the snippet's meta data is identical
        to `application/json` requests.

        To update one of a snippet's file contents, while also changing its
        title:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 288
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="

            --===============1438169132528273974==

            MIME-Version: 1.0
            Content-ID: snippet

            {
              "title": "My updated snippet",
              "files": {
                  "foo.txt": {}
                }
            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==

            Content-ID: "foo.txt"
            Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="foo.txt"

            Updated file contents.

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        Here only the parts that are changed are included in the body. The
        other files remain untouched.

        Note the use of the `files` list in the JSON part. This list contains
        the files that are being manipulated. This list should have
        corresponding multiparts in the request that contain the new contents
        of these files.

        If a filename in the `files` list does not have a corresponding part,
        it will be deleted from the snippet, as shown below:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 188
            Content-Type: multipart/related; start="snippet"; boundary="===============1438169132528273974=="

            }

            --===============1438169132528273974==--

        To simulate a rename, delete a file and add the same file under
        another name:

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 212

            --===============1438169132528273974==--


        multipart/form-data
        -----------------

        Again, one can also use `multipart/form-data` to manipulate file
        contents and meta data atomically.

            $ curl -X PUT http://localhost:12345/2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj             -F title="My updated snippet" -F file=@foo.txt

            PUT /2.0/snippets/evzijst/kypj HTTP/1.1
            Content-Length: 351
            Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----------------------------63a4b224c59f

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="foo.txt"
            Content-Type: text/plain

            foo

            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f
            Content-Disposition: form-data; name="title"

            My updated snippet
            ------------------------------63a4b224c59f

        To delete a file, omit its contents while including its name in the

        The explicit use of the `files` element in `multipart/related` and
        `multipart/form-data` is only required when deleting files.
        The default mode of operation is for file parts to be processed,
        regardless of whether or not they are listed in `files`, as a
        convenience to the client.

        Returns an object for each repository permission for all of a
        team’s repositories.

        **This endpoint has been deprecated,
        and you should use the [workspace repository permissions](../../../workspaces/%7Bworkspace%7D/permissions/repositories) endpoint.
        For more information, see [the announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-teams-deprecation/).**

        If the username URL parameter refers to a user account instead of
        a team account, an object containing the repository permissions
        of all the username's repositories will be returned.

        Permissions returned are effective permissions — the highest level of
        permission the user has. This does not include public repositories that
        users are not granted any specific permission in, and does not
        distinguish between direct and indirect privileges.

        Only users with admin permission for the team may access this resource.

        Permissions can be:

        * `admin`
        * `write`
        * `read`

        Example:

        ```
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/atlassian_tutorial/permissions/repositories

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        ### Update

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the
        project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

        ```

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both as in the example above.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI, e.g.
        to only search within a specific repository:

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/team_name/search/code?search_query=foo+repo:demo'
        # results from the "demo" repository
        ```

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`):

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/team_name/search/code'\
             '?search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository'
        {

                "path": "src/foo.py",
                "type": "commit_file",
                "links": {
                  "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/demo/src/ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b/src/foo.py"
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both as in the example above.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI, e.g.
        to only search within a specific repository:

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/{ed08f5e1-605b-4f4a-aee4-6c97628a673e}/search/code?search_query=foo+repo:demo'
        # results from the "demo" repository
        ```

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`):

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/{ed08f5e1-605b-4f4a-aee4-6c97628a673e}/search/code'\
             '?search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository'

        Results may be further [filtered or sorted](../meta/filtering) by
        workspace or permission by adding the following query string parameters:

        * `q=slug="bbworkspace1"` or `q=is_private=true`
        * `sort=created_on`

        Note that the query parameter values need to be URL escaped so that `=`
        would become `%3D`.

        Returns an object for the repository permission of each user in the
        requested repository.

        Permissions returned are effective permissions: the highest level of
        permission the user has. This does not distinguish between direct and
        indirect (group) privileges.

        Only users with admin permission for the repository may access this resource.

        Permissions can be:

        * `admin`
        * `write`
        * `read`

        Since this endpoint can be used to both update and to create a
        project, the request body depends on the intent.

        ### Creation

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The `key` should not be specified in the body of request
        (since it is already present in the URL). The `name` is required,
        everything else is optional.

        ### Update

        See the POST documentation for the project collection for an
        example of the request body.

        Note: The key is not required in the body (since it is already in
        the URL). The key may be specified in the body, if the intent is
        to change the key itself. In such a scenario, the location of the
        project is changed and is returned in the `Location` header of the
        response.

                "links": {
                  "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/my-workspace/demo/src/ad6964b5fe2880dbd9ddcad1c89000f1dbcbc24b/src/foo.py"

              }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

        Note that searches can match in the file's text (`content_matches`),
        the path (`path_matches`), or both as in the example above.

        You can use the same syntax for the search query as in the UI, e.g.
        to only search within a specific repository:

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/my-workspace/search/code?search_query=foo+repo:demo'
        # results from the "demo" repository
        ```

        Similar to other APIs, you can request more fields using a
        `fields` query parameter. E.g. to get some more information about
        the repository of matched files (the `%2B` is a URL-encoded `+`):

        ```
        curl 'https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/workspaces/my-workspace/search/code'\
             '?search_query=foo&fields=%2Bvalues.file.commit.repository'

        ### OAuth 2.0

        Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in
        such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become
        valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your
        existing consumer and configure a callback URL.

        Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

        For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support all 4 of RFC-6749's grant
        flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access tokens:


        #### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)

        The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by
        sending their browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

        The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap
        for an access token:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


        #### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)

        This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without server-side backends.

        Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

        That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment
        containing the access token
        (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can
        pull it out of the URL.


        #### 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3)

        Useful if you have the end user's password but you want to use a more
        secure end user access token instead. This method will not work when the user has two-step verification enabled.

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=password \
              -d username={username} -d password={password}


        #### 4. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)

        Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access
        token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the
        client/consumer:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=client_credentials


        #### 5. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)

        If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a
        JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the
        account for which the add-on is installed.

        Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header
        using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme
        makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl
        -u").

            $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


        #### Making Requests

        Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a request in any of
        the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):

        1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
        2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as `access_token={access_token}`
        3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST: `?access_token={access_token}`


        #### Repository Cloning

        Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone
        with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to
        clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly
        different:

            $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

        The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is
        required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in
        the username field).


        #### Refresh Tokens

        Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401
        responses.

        Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded). Therefore, you should include a
        refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,
        without the need for end user participation:

            $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
              https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
              -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


        ### Scopes

        Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary scopes.

        Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each string being the name of a unique scope.

        A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users authorizing/installing the add-on
        to explicitly accept all scopes.

        Our best practice suggests you add the scopes your add-on needs, but no more than it needs.

        Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the installation to fail.

        Following is the set of all currently available scopes.

        #### repository

        Gives the add-on read access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to.
        Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull requests.

        * access to the repo's source code
        * clone over https
        * access the the file browsing API
        * download zip archives of the repo's contents
        * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment, vote, etc)
        * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)

        #### repository:write

        Gives the add-on write (not admin) access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope implies `repository`, which does not need to be requested separately.
        This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.

        * push access over https
        * fork repos

        #### repository:admin

        Gives the add-on admin access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope does not imply `repository` or `repository:write`. It gives access to the admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. Of course it can be (mis)used to grant read access to another user account who can then clone the repo, but repos that need to read of write source code would also request explicit read or write.
        This scope comes with access to the following functionality:

        * view and manipulate committer mappings
        * list and edit deploy keys
        * ability to delete the repo
        * view and edit repo permissions
        * view and edit branch permissions
        * import and export the issue tracker
        * enable and disable the issue tracker
        * list and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components
        * enable and disable the wiki
        * list and edit default reviewers
        * list and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)
        * list and edit the repository web hooks
        * initiate a repo ownership transfer

        #### snippet

        Gives the add-on read access to all the snippets the authorizing user has access to.
        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

        * view any snippet
        * create snippet comments

        #### snippet:write

        Gives the add-on write access to all the snippets the authorizing user can edit.
        No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).
        This implies the Snippet Read scope which does not need to be requested separately.

        * edit snippets
        * delete snippets

        #### issue

        Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.
        This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.

        * view, list and search issues
        * create new issues
        * comment on issues
        * watch issues
        * vote for issues

        #### issue:write

        This implies `issue`, but adds the ability to transition and delete issues.
        This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.

        * transition issues
        * delete issues

        #### wiki

        Gives access to wikis. No distinction is made between read and write as wikis are always editable by anyone.
        This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the wiki is attached to.

        * view wikis
        * create pages
        * edit pages
        * push to wikis
        * clone wikis

        #### pullrequest

        Gives the add-on read access to pull requests.
        This scope implies `repository`, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository.

        * see and list pull requests
        * create and resolve tasks

        #### pullrequest:write

        Implies `pullrequest` but adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.
        This scope implies `repository:write`, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to facilitate merging.

        * merge pull requests
        * decline pull requests
        * create pull requests
        * comment on pull requests
        * approve pull requests

        #### email

        Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider to add-ons or external applications.

        #### account

        Ability to see all the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data.

        * see all email addresses
        * language
        * location
        * website
        * full name
        * SSH keys
        * user groups

        #### account:write

        Ability to change properties on the user's account.

        * delete the authorizing user's account
        * manage the user's groups
        * manupilate a user's email addresses
        * change username, display name and avatar

        #### team

        The ability to find out what teams the current user is part of. This is covered by the teams endpoint.

        * information about all the groups and teams I am a member or admin of


        #### team:write

        Implies `team`, but adds the ability to manage the teams that the authorizing user is an admin on.

        * manage team permissions

        #### webhook

        Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook
        related operation.

        This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all
        resources you can access, without needing further scopes. This means that
        a client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on repository
        `foo/bar` (assuming the principal user has access to this repo). The
        additional `repository` scope is not required for this.

        Likewise, existing webhook subscriptions for a repo's issue tracker can be
        retrieved without holding the `issue` scope. All that is required is the
        `webhook` scope.

        However, to create a webhook for `issue:created`, the client will need to
        have both the `webhook` as well as `issue` scope.

        * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team, or snippet
        * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions

        ### pipeline

        Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and variables.

        ### pipeline:write

        Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:
        * Stop pipelines
        * Rerun failed pipelines
        * Resume halted pipelines
        * Trigger manual pipelines.

        This scope is not needed to trigger a build via a push. The act to doing push will trigger the build. The token doing the push only needs repository:write scope.

        This does not give write access to create variables.

        ### pipeline:variable

        Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various levels:
        * Workspace
        * Repository
        * Deployment

        ### runner

        Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.

        ### runner:write

        Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.

        ### App passwords

        App passwords allow two-step verification users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account through apps such as Sourcetree.

        Some important points about app passwords:

        * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just create a new one.
        * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.
        * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

            App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

        * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have two-step verification enabled.
        * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app password.

        #### Create an app password

        To create an app password:

        1. Select **Avatar > Bitbucket settings**.
        2. [Click **App passwords** in the Access management section.](https://bitbucket.org/account/admin/app-passwords)
        3. Click **Create app password**.
        4. Give the app password a name related to the application that will use the password.
        5. Select the specific access and permissions you want this application password to have.
        6. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access. The password is only displayed this one time.

        That's all there is to creating an app password. See your applications documentation for how to apply the app password for a specific application.

        ### Basic auth

        Basic HTTP Authentication as per [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported). Note that Basic Auth with username and password as credentials is only available on accounts that have 2-factor-auth / 2-step-verification disabled. If you use 2fa, you should authenticate using OAuth2 instead.

        You can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.

        Note that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes. 
        See the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying) 
        for details.

        ----

        ### Supported endpoints

        Most 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.

        This includes, but is in no way limited to:

            /2.0/repositories/{username}
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/branches
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/forks
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/src
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/issues
            /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/pullrequests

        Filtering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).
        As examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):

        	(state = "open" OR state = "new") AND assignee = null
        	reporter.nickname != "evzijst" AND priority >= "major"
        	(title ~ "unicode" OR content.raw ~ "unicode") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00

        Filter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:

        	/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state="new"&sort=-updated_on


        ### Operators

        Filtering and sorting supports the following operators:

        | Operator | Definition                     | Example                    |
        |----------|--------------------------------|----------------------------|
        | "="      | test for equality              | `nickname = "evzijst"`     |
        | "!="     | not equal                      | `is_private != true`       |
        | "~"      | case-insensitive text contains | `description ~ "beef"`     |
        | "!~"     | case-insensitive not contains  | `description !~ "fubar"`   |
        | ">"      | greater than                   | `priority > "major"`       |
        | ">="     | greater than or equal          | `priority <= "trivial"`    |
        | "<"      | less than                      | `id < 1234`                |
        | "<="     | less than or equal             | `updated_on <= 2015-03-04` |

        ### Data types

        Filtering and sorting supports the following data types:

        | Type         | Description                             | Example       |
        |--------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
        | **String**   | any text inside double quotes           | `"foo"`       |
        | **Number**   | arbitrary precision integers and floats | `1, -10.302`  |
        | **Null**     | to test for the absence of a value      | `null`        |
        | **boolean**  | the unquoted strings true or false      | `true, false` |
        | **datetime** | an unquoted [ISO-8601][iso-8601] date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional | `2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00`, `2015-03-04T14:08:59` Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided |

        [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601]: /iso-8601

        ### Querying

        Objects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.

        Note that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an
        envelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the
        query fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state="new"`, not
        `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state="new"`).


        ### Examples

        Fields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. owner is an embedded user object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:

        	parent.owner.nickname = "bitbucket"

        To find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:

        ```
        source.repository.full_name != "main/repo" AND state = "OPEN" AND reviewers.nickname = "evzijst" AND destination.branch.name = "master"
        ```
        ```
        /2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22
        ```

        To find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:

        ```
        (state = "new" OR state = "on hold") AND assignee = null AND component = "UI" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00
        ```
        ```
        /2.0/repositories/main/repo/issues?q=%28state+%3D+%22new%22+OR+state+%3D+%22on+hold%22%29+AND+assignee+%3D+null+AND+component+%3D+%22UI%22+and+updated_on+%3E+2015-11-11T00%3A00%3A00-07%3A00
        ```

        To find all tags with the string "2015" in the name:

        ```
        name ~ "2015"
        ```
        ```
        /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/tags?q=name+%7E+%222015%22
        ```
        Or all my branches:

        ```
        name ~ "erik/"
        ```
        ```
        /2.0/repositories/{username}/{slug}/refs/?q=name+%7E+%22erik%2F%22
        ```
        ### Sorting query results

        You can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:

        * In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.
        * By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).

        Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply pagination.
        Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper object:

        ```json
        {
          "size": 5421,
          "page": 2,
          "pagelen": 10,
          "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
          "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
          "values": [
            ...
          ]
        }
        ```

        Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating which
        page is to be returned.

        However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by manipulating
        the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link to the
        next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not to be
        constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only contract
        around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.

        Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.

        The paginated response contains the following fields:

        | Field      | Value    |
        |------------|----------|
        | `size`     | Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute. |
        | `page`     | Page number of the current results. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. |
        | `pagelen`  | Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally, the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a different default. |
        | `next`     | Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |
        | `previous` | Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs. |
        | `values`   | The list of objects. This contains at most `pagelen` objects. |

        The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous and size values can be expensive for some data sets.

        It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered, finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud, list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.

        However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite – much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else. In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses iterator-based pagination.

    - anchor: partial-response
      body: |
        
        By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource and in
        some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of pull
        requests can amount to quite a large document.

        For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields you
        really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and to
        add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query
        parameter.


        ### Example

        Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related
        resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is
        somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.

        To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:

        ```json
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links
        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }
        ```

        ### Fields parameter syntax

        The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:

        1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)
        2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint, while
           still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
        3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g. `owner.display_name`)

        The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated field names
        (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter itself is
        not repeated.

        As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full Objects](serialization#representations),
        most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is an
        embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that omits
        many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional fields in
        such cases.

        For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not normally
        contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:
        `+values.destination.repository.owner`.


        ### Wildcards

        The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For
        example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like this:

        ```json
        $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*
        {
          "nickname": "evzijst",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "",
          "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
          "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
          "links": {},
          "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
          "location": null,
          "type": "user"
        }
        ```

        Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For
        instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level and then
        add in `foo` and `bar`.


        ### URL encoding

        Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that the
        "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:

        ```
        https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on
        ```

        Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will not
        match any fields.


        ### Field discovery

        While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically return
        the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for fields that
        are overly verbose or costly to generate.

        For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers and
        participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not from the
        `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too much.

        To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,
        `fields=*` can be used.


        ### More examples

        If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I created,
        we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This will omit
        all other data from the response:

        ```
        /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22

                {
                  "nickname": "zdavis"
                },
                {
                  "nickname": "flexbox"
                }
              ],
              "state": "OPEN",
              "id": 11344
            }
          ]
        }

        ### Open API Specification

        Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,
        formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification schema
        is hosted at [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)
        and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of all
        available endpoints.

        The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:
        auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing with
        authentication and error handling.

        You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification at:
        [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).


        ### JSON Schema

        Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of object
        consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the
        `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.

        When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also expects
        the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to objects
        returned by an endpoint.


        ### Condensed Versus Full Objects

        Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial" representation.
        The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the layout
        returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g. `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),
        as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).

        However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a `repository`
        object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest` object
        embeds its `repository` object.

        These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter" when
        clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on common,
        related information.

        Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid such
        object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their own
        nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and
        utility.

        An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be standardized,
        meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the object
        was embedded.

        You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of Bitbucket's REST implementation.

        ### URI structure

        All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).

        The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request. For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org
        ```
        Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository is an example:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues
        ```

        #### HTTP methods

        A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP methods:

        | Call | Description |
        |------|-------------|
        | GET    | Retrieves information. |
        | PUT    | Updates existing information. |
        | POST   | Creates new information. |
        | DELETE | Removes existing information. |

        For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and create an issue on the issue tracker.

        **Specifying content length**

        You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:

        ```
        curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:pass https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com
        ```

        ### Universally Unique Identifier

        UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but not if you are pointing to the UUID.

        #### UUID examples and structure

        UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and repository objects. The following examples the following characters are replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.

        #### User object and UUID

        When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user the response is the same.

        **Call with username**:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials
        ```

        ***Call with UUID for the user**:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D
        ```

        **Response**

            "type": "user"
        }
        ```

        #### Repository object and UUID

        Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name changes.

        **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie
        ```
        **Call with UUID and empty field**:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D
        ```

        **Call with UUID and teamname**:

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D
        ```

        #### Team object and UUID

        This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either case.

        **Call with teamname**

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members
        ```
        **Call with UUID for team object**

        ```
        curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

        ### Standardized error responses

        The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a JSON
        object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object provides a
        detailed  problem description.

        ```json
        {
            "type": "error",
            "error": {
                "message": "Bad request",
                "fields": {
                    "src": [
                        "This field is required."
                    ]
                },
                "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
                "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
                "data": {
                  "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
                }
            }
        }
        ```

        This object contains an error element which contains the following nested
        elements:

        | Element | Description |
        | message | A short description of the problem. This element is always present. Its value may be localized. |
        | fields  | This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The values may be localized. |
        | detail  | An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value may be localized.</td>
        | id      | An optional unique error identifier that identifies the error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem. |

        ### Standard ISO-8601 timestamps

        All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original timezone.

        This section describes [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS), what content types we support in requests and responses, and hyperlinking resources in each json responses.

        ### Cors

        The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information you can refer to:

        * [Wikipedia article on CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
        * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)

        Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:

        `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`

        Gives this result:

            HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND
            Server: nginx/1.6.2

        ### Supported content types

        The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by the client.

        Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your client can omit immutable fields from a request body.

        In some cases, a resource might also accept regular application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects always require JSON.

        ### Resource links

        Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting" function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a specific user:


        `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`

        ```json
        {
            "username": "tutorials",
            "nickname": "tutorials",
            "account_status": "active",
            "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
            "display_name": "tutorials account",
            "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
            "links": {
                "self": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
                },
                "repositories": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
                },
                "html": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
                },
                "followers": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
                },
                "avatar": {
                    "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
                },
                "following": {
                    "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
                }
            },
            "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
            "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
            "type": "user"
        }
        ```
        Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API responses.

        A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following link:

        ```json
        "self": {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
        }
        ```

        The rel for this link is self and the href is https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.

        Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below, the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects. Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.

        ```json
        "links": {
          "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
          },
          "clone": [
            {
              "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "https"
            },
            {
              "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
              "name": "ssh"
            }
          ],
          ...
        }
        ```
        Links can support [URI Templates](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570); Those that do contain a `"templated": "true"` element.

        You can use the Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud to build add-ons which
        can connect with the Bitbucket UI and your own application set. An add-on could
        be an integration with another existing service, new features for the Atlassian
        application, or even a new product that runs within the Atlassian application.

      # Bitbucket Cloud OAuth 2.0 <a name="oauth-2"></a>

      Our OAuth 2 implementation is merged in with our existing OAuth 1 in
      such a way that existing OAuth 1 consumers automatically become
      valid OAuth 2 clients. The only thing you need to do is edit your
      existing consumer and configure a callback URL.

      Once that is in place, you'll have the following 2 URLs:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize
          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token

      For obtaining access/bearer tokens, we support all 4 of RFC-6749's grant
      flows, plus a custom Bitbucket flow for exchanging JWT tokens for access tokens:


      ### 1. Authorization Code Grant (4.1)

      The full-blown 3-LO flow. Request authorization from the end user by
      sending their browser to:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=code

      The callback includes the `?code={}` query parameter that you can swap
      for an access token:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=authorization_code -d code={code}


      ### 2. Implicit Grant (4.2)

      This flow is useful for browser-based add-ons that operate without server-side backends.

      Request the end user for authorization by directing the browser to:

          https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/authorize?client_id={client_id}&response_type=token

      That will redirect to your preconfigured callback URL with a fragment
      containing the access token
      (`#access_token={token}&token_type=bearer`) where your page's js can
      pull it out of the URL.


      ### 3. Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (4.3)

      Useful if you have the end user's password but you want to use a more
      secure end user access token instead. This method will not work when the user has two-step verification enabled.

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token -d grant_type=password \
            -d username={username} -d password={password}


      ### 4. Client Credentials Grant (4.4)

      Somewhat like our existing "2-LO" flow for OAuth 1. Obtain an access
      token that represents not an end user, but the owner of the
      client/consumer:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=client_credentials


      ### 5. Bitbucket Cloud JWT Grant (urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt)

      If your Atlassian Connect add-on uses JWT authentication, you can swap a
      JWT for an OAuth access token. The resulting access token represents the
      account for which the add-on is installed.

      Make sure you send the JWT token in the Authorization request header
      using the "JWT" scheme (case sensitive). Note that this custom scheme
      makes this different from HTTP Basic Auth (and so you cannot use "curl
      -u").

          $ curl -X POST -H "Authorization: JWT {jwt_token}" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=urn:bitbucket:oauth2:jwt


      ## Making Requests <a name="make-requests"></a>

      Once you have an access token, as per RFC-6750, you can use it in a request in any of
      the following ways (in decreasing order of desirability):

      1. Send it in a request header: `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
      2. Include it in a (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) POST body as `access_token={access_token}`
      3. Put it in the query string of a non-POST: `?access_token={access_token}`


      ## Repository Cloning <a name="repo-clone"></a>

      Since add-ons will not be able to upload their own SSH keys to clone
      with, access tokens can be used as Basic HTTP Auth credentials to
      clone securely over HTTPS. This is much like GitHub, yet slightly
      different:

          $ git clone https://x-token-auth:{access_token}@bitbucket.org/user/repo.git

      The literal string `x-token-auth` as a substitute for username is
      required (note the difference with GitHub where the actual token is in
      the username field).


      ## Refresh Tokens <a name="refresh-tokens"></a>

      Our access tokens expire in one hour. When this happens you'll get 401
      responses.

      Most access tokens grant responses (Implicit and JWT excluded). Therefore, you should include a
      refresh token that can then be used to generate a new access token,
      without the need for end user participation:

          $ curl -X POST -u "client_id:secret" \
            https://bitbucket.org/site/oauth2/access_token \
            -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token={refresh_token}


      # Scopes for the Bitbucket Cloud REST API <a name="scopes-bbc"></a>

      Bitbucket's API applies a number of privilege scopes to endpoints. In order to access an endpoint, a request will need to have the necessary scopes.

      Scopes are declared in the descriptor as a list of strings, with each string being the name of a unique scope.

      A descriptor lacking the `scopes` element is implicitly assumed to require all scopes and as a result, Bitbucket will require end users authorizing/installing the add-on
      to explicitly accept all scopes.

      Our best practice suggests you add the scopes your add-on needs, but no more than it needs.

      Invalid scope strings will cause the descriptor to be rejected and the installation to fail.

      Following is the set of all currently available scopes.

      ### repository

      Gives the add-on read access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to.
      Note that this scope does not give access to a repository's pull requests.

      * access to the repo's source code
      * clone over https
      * access the the file browsing API
      * download zip archives of the repo's contents
      * the ability to view and use the issue tracker on any repo (created issues, comment, vote, etc)
      * the ability to view and use the wiki on any repo (create/edit pages)

      ### repository:write

      Gives the add-on write (not admin) access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope implies `repository`, which does not need to be requested separately.
      This scope alone does not give access to the pull requests API.

      * push access over https
      * fork repos

      ### repository:admin

      Gives the add-on admin access to all the repositories the authorizing user has access to. No distinction is made between public or private repos. This scope does not imply `repository` or `repository:write`. It gives access to the admin features of a repo only, not direct access to its contents. Of course it can be (mis)used to grant read access to another user account who can then clone the repo, but repos that need to read of write source code would also request explicit read or write.
      This scope comes with access to the following functionality:

      * view and manipulate committer mappings
      * list and edit deploy keys
      * ability to delete the repo
      * view and edit repo permissions
      * view and edit branch permissions
      * import and export the issue tracker
      * enable and disable the issue tracker
      * list and edit issue tracker version, milestones and components
      * enable and disable the wiki
      * list and edit default reviewers
      * list and edit repo links (Jira/Bamboo/Custom)
      * list and edit the repository web hooks
      * initiate a repo ownership transfer

      ### snippet

      Gives the add-on read access to all the snippets the authorizing user has access to.
      No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).

      * view any snippet
      * create snippet comments

      ### snippet:write

      Gives the add-on write access to all the snippets the authorizing user can edit.
      No distinction is made between public and private snippets (public snippets are accessible without any form of authentication).
      This implies the Snippet Read scope which does not need to be requested separately.

      * edit snippets
      * delete snippets

      ### issue

      Ability to interact with issue trackers the way non-repo members can.
      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.

      * view, list and search issues
      * create new issues
      * comment on issues
      * watch issues
      * vote for issues

      ### issue:write

      This implies `issue`, but adds the ability to transition and delete issues.
      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the issue is attached to.

      * transition issues
      * delete issues

      ### wiki

      Gives access to wikis. No distinction is made between read and write as wikis are always editable by anyone.
      This scope does not imply any other scopes and does not give implicit access to the repository the wiki is attached to.

      * view wikis
      * create pages
      * edit pages
      * push to wikis
      * clone wikis

      ### pullrequest

      Gives the add-on read access to pull requests.
      This scope implies `repository`, giving read access to the pull request's destination repository.

      * see and list pull requests
      * create and resolve tasks

      ### pullrequest:write

      Implies `pullrequest` but adds the ability to create, merge and decline pull requests.
      This scope implies `repository:write`, giving write access to the pull request's destination repository. This is necessary to facilitate merging.

      * merge pull requests
      * decline pull requests
      * create pull requests
      * comment on pull requests
      * approve pull requests

      ### email

      Ability to see the user's primary email address. This should make it easier to use Bitbucket Cloud as a login provider to add-ons or external applications.

      ### account

      Ability to see all the user's account information. Note that this does not include any ability to mutate any of the data.

      * see all email addresses
      * language
      * location
      * website
      * full name
      * SSH keys
      * user groups

      ### account:write

      Ability to change properties on the user's account.

      * delete the authorizing user's account
      * manage the user's groups
      * manupilate a user's email addresses
      * change username, display name and avatar

      ### team

      The ability to find out what teams the current user is part of. This is covered by the teams endpoint.

      * information about all the groups and teams I am a member or admin of


      ### team:write

      Implies `team`, but adds the ability to manage the teams that the authorizing user is an admin on.

      * manage team permissions

      ### webhook

      Gives access to webhooks. This scope is required for any webhook
      related operation.

      This scope gives read access to existing webhook subscriptions on all
      resources you can access, without needing further scopes. This means that
      a client can list all existing webhook subscriptions on repository
      `foo/bar` (assuming the principal user has access to this repo). The
      additional `repository` scope is not required for this.

      Likewise, existing webhook subscriptions for a repo's issue tracker can be
      retrieved without holding the `issue` scope. All that is required is the
      `webhook` scope.

      However, to create a webhook for `issue:created`, the client will need to
      have both the `webhook` as well as `issue` scope.

      * list webhook subscriptions on any accessible repository, user, team, or snippet
      * create/update/delete webhook subscriptions

      ### pipeline

      Gives read-only access to pipelines, steps, deployment environments and variables.

      ### pipeline:write

      Gives write access to pipelines. This scope allows a user to:
      * Stop pipelines
      * Rerun failed pipelines
      * Resume halted pipelines
      * Trigger manual pipelines.

      This scope is not needed to trigger a build via a push. The act to doing push will trigger the build. The token doing the push only needs repository:write scope.

      This does not give write access to create variables.

      ### pipeline:variable

      Gives write access to create variables in pipelines at the various levels:
      * Workspace
      * Repository
      * Deployment

      ### runner

      Gives read-only access to pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.

      ### runner:write

      Gives write access to create/edit/disable/delete pipelines runners setup against a workspace or repository.

      # App passwords <a name="app-pw"></a>

      App passwords allow two-step verification users to make API calls to their Bitbucket account through apps such as Sourcetree.

      Some important points about app passwords:

      * You cannot view an app password or adjust permissions after you create the app password. Because app passwords are encrypted on our database and cannot be viewed by anyone. They are essentially designed to be disposable. If you need to change the scopes or lost the password just create a new one.
      * You cannot use them to log into your Bitbucket account.
      * You cannot use app passwords to manage team actions.

          App passwords are tied to an individual account's credentials and should not be shared. If you're sharing your app password you're essentially giving direct, authenticated, access to everything that password has been scoped to do with the Bitbucket API's.

      * You can use them for API call authentication, even if you don't have two-step verification enabled.
      * You can set permission scopes (specific access rights) for each app password.

      ### Create an app password

      To create an app password:

      1. Select **Avatar > Bitbucket settings**.
      2. [Click **App passwords** in the Access management section.](https://bitbucket.org/account/admin/app-passwords)
      3. Click **Create app password**.
      4. Give the app password a name related to the application that will use the password.
      5. Select the specific access and permissions you want this application password to have.
      6. Copy the generated password and either record or paste it into the application you want to give access. The password is only displayed this one time.

      That's all there is to creating an app password. See your applications documentation for how to apply the app password for a specific application.

      ## Basic auth <a name="basic-auth"></a>

      Basic HTTP Authentication as per [RFC-2617](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617) (Digest not supported). Note that Basic Auth with username and password as credentials is only available on accounts that have 2-factor-auth / 2-step-verification disabled. If you use 2fa, you should authenticate using OAuth2 instead.

      # Filter and sort API objects

      You can query the 2.0 API for specific objects using a simple language which resembles SQL.

      Note that filtering and querying by username has been deprecated, due to privacy changes.
      See the [announcement](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/bitbucket-api-changes-gdpr/#changes-to-querying)
      for details.

      ### Supported endpoints <a name="supp-endpoints"></a>

      Most 2.0 API resources that return paginated collections of objects support a single, shared, generic querying language that is used to filter down a result set.

      This includes, but is in no way limited to:

          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/refs
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/refs/branches
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/refs/tags
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/forks
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/src
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues
          /2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/pullrequests

      Filtering and sorting supports several distinct operators and data types as well as basic features, like logical operators (AND, OR).
      As examples, the following queries could be used on the issue tracker endpoint (`/2.0/repositories/{workspace}/{slug}/issues/`):

      	(state = "open" OR state = "new") AND assignee = null
      	reporter.nickname != "evzijst" AND priority >= "major"
      	(title ~ "unicode" OR content.raw ~ "unicode") AND created_on > 2015-10-04T14:00:00-07:00

      Filter queries can be added to the URL using the q=<query> query parameter. To sort the response, add sort=<field>. Note that the entire query string is put in the q parameter and hence needs to be URL-encoded as shown in the following example:

      	/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state="new"&sort=-updated_on


      ### Operators <a name="operators"></a>

      Filtering and sorting supports the following operators:

      <table class='aui'>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Operator</th>
                  <th>Definition</th>
                  <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tr>
              <td>"="</td>
              <td>test for equality </td>
              <td><code>nickname = "evzijst"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>"!="</td>
              <td>not equal</td>
              <td><code>is_private != true</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>"~"</td>
              <td>case-insensitive text contains </td>
              <td><code>description ~ "beef"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>"!~"</td>
              <td>case-insensitive not contains </td>
              <td><code>description !~ "fubar"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>">"</td>
              <td>greater than</td>
              <td><code>priority > "major"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>">="</td>
              <td>greater than or equal</td>
              <td><code>priority <= "trivial"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>"<"</td>
              <td>less than</td>
              <td><code>id < 1234</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>"<="</td>
              <td>less than or equal </td>
              <td><code>updated_on <= 2015-03-04</code></td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      ### Data types <a name="data-types"></a>

      Filtering and sorting supports the following data types:

      <table class='aui'>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Type</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
                  <th>Example</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tr>
              <td><b>String</b></td>
              <td>any text inside double quotes</td>
              <td><code>"foo"</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>Number</b></td>
              <td>arbitrary precision integers and floats</td>
              <td><code>1, -10.302</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>Null</b></td>
              <td>to test for the absence of a value</td>
              <td><code>null</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>boolean</b></td>
              <td>the unquoted strings true or false</td>
              <td><code>true, false</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><b>datetime</b></td>
              <td>an unquoted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO-8601</a> date time string with the timezone offset, milliseconds and entire time component being optional</td>
              <td><code>2015-03-04T14:08:59.123+02:00</code>, <code>2015-03-04T14:08:59</code> Date time strings are assumed to be in UTC, unless an explicit timezone offset is provided.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      ## Querying <a name="querying"></a>

      Objects can be filtered based on their properties. In principle, every element in an object's JSON document schema can be used as a filter criterion.

      Note that while the array of objects in a paginated response is wrapped in an
      envelope with a `values` element, this prefix should not be included in the
      query fields (so use `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=state="new"`, not
      `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar/issues?q=values.state="new"`).


      ### Examples

      Fields that contain embedded instances of other object types (e.g. workspace is an embedded workspace object, while parent is an embedded repository) can be traversed recursively. For instance:

      	parent.workspace.slug = "bitbucket"

      To find pull requests which merge into master, come from a fork of the repo rather than a branch inside the repo, and on which I am a reviewer:

      ```
      source.repository.full_name != "main/repo" AND state = "OPEN" AND reviewers.nickname = "evzijst" AND destination.branch.name = "master"
      ```
      ```
      /2.0/repositories/main/repo/pullrequests?q=source.repository.full_name+%21%3D+%22main%2Frepo%22+AND+state+%3D+%22OPEN%22+AND+reviewers.nickname+%3D+%22evzijst%22+AND+destination.branch.name+%3D+%22master%22
      ```

      To find new or on-hold issues related to the UI, created or updated in the last day (SF local time), that have not yet been assigned to anyone:

      ```
      (state = "new" OR state = "on hold") AND assignee = null AND component = "UI" and updated_on > 2015-11-11T00:00:00-07:00

      ## Sorting query results <a name="query-sort"></a>

      You can sort result sets using the ?sort=<field> query parameter, available on the same resources that support filtering:

      * In principle, every field that can be queried can also be used as a key for sorting.
      * By default the sort order is ascending. To reverse the order, prefix the field name with a hyphen (e.g. ?sort=-updated_on).
      * Only one field can be sorted on. Compound fields (e.g. sort on state first, followed by updated_on) are not supported.

      # Pagination

      Endpoints that return collections of objects should always apply pagination.
      Paginated collections are always wrapped in the following wrapper object:

      ```json
      {
        "size": 5421,
        "page": 2,
        "pagelen: 10,
        "next": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=3",
        "previous": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/pypy/pypy/commits?page=1",
        "values": [
          ...
        ]
      }
      ```

      Pagination is often page-bound, with a query parameter page indicating which
      page is to be returned.

      However, clients are not expected to construct URLs themselves by manipulating
      the page number query parameter. Instead, the response contains a link to the
      next page. This link should be treated as an opaque location that is not to be
      constructed by clients or even assumed to be predictable. The only contract
      around the next link is that it will return the next chunk of results.

      Lack of a next link in the response indicates the end of the collection.

      The paginated response contains the following fields:

      <table class='aui'>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Field</th>
                  <th>Value</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tr>
              <td><code>size</code></td>
              <td>Total number of objects in the response. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses, as it can be expensive to compute. </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><code>page</code></td>
              <td>Page number of the current results. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><code>pagelen</code></td>
              <td>Current number of objects on the existing page. Globally, the minimum length is 10 and the maximum is 100. Some APIs may specify a different default.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><code>next</code></td>
              <td>Link to the next page if it exists. The last page of a collection does not have this value. Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><code>previous</code></td>
              <td>Link to previous page if it exists. A collections first page does not have this value. This is an optional element that is not provided in all responses. Some result sets strictly support forward navigation and never provide previous links. Clients must anticipate that backwards navigation is not always available.
              Use this link to navigate the result set and refrain from constructing your own URLs.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td><code>values</code></td>
              <td>The list of objects. This contains at most <code>pagelen</code> objects.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      The link to the next page is included such that you don't have to hardcode or construct any links.  Only values and next are guaranteed (except the last page, which lacks next). This is because the previous and size values can be expensive for some data sets.

      It is important to realize that Bitbucket support both list-based pagination and iterator-based pagination. List-based pagination assumes that the collection is a discrete, immutable, consistently ordered, finite array of objects with a fixed size. Clients navigate a list-based collection by requesting offset-based chunks. In Bitbucket Cloud, list-based responses include the optional size, page, and previous element. The the next and previous links typically resemble something like /foo/bar?page=4.

      However, not all result sets can be treated as immutable and finite – much like how programming languages tend to distinguish between lists and arrays on one hand and iterators or stream on the other. Where an list-based pagination offers random access into any point in a collection, iterator-based pagination can only navigate forward one element at a time. In Bitbucket such iterator-based pagination contains the next link and pagelen elements, but not necessarily anything else. In these cases, the next link's value often contains an unpredictable hash instead of an explicit page number. The commits resource uses iterator-based pagination.

      # Partial responses

      By default, each endpoint returns the full representation of a resource and in
      some cases that can be a lot of data. For example, retrieving a list of pull
      requests can amount to quite a large document.

      For better performance, you can ask the server to only return the fields you
      really need and to omit unwanted data. To request a partial response and to
      add or remove specific fields from a response, use the `fields` query
      parameter.


      ## Example

      Most API resources embed a substantial list of links pointing to related
      resources. This saves the client from constructing its own URLs, but is
      somewhat wasteful when the client doesn't need them.

      To significantly reduce the size of the response, use `?fields=-links`:

      ```json
      $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links
      {
        "nickname": "evzijst",
        "account_status": "active",
        "website": "",
        "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
        "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
        "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
        "location": null,
        "type": "user"
      }
      ```

      ## Fields parameter syntax

      The `fields` parameter supports 3 modes of operation:

      1. Removal of select fields (e.g. `-links`)
      2. Pulling in additional fields not normally returned by an endpoint, while
         still getting all the default fields (e.g. `+reviewers`)
      3. Omitting all fields, except those specified (e.g. `owner.display_name`)

      The fields parameter can contain a list of multiple comma-separated field names
      (e.g. `fields=owner.display_name,uuid,links.self.href`). The parameter itself is
      not repeated.

      As discussed at [Condensed Versus Full Objects](serialization#representations),
      most objects that are embedded inside other objects (like how `owner` is an
      embedded `user` object in `repository`) appear in "condensed" form that omits
      many fields. The `fields` parameter allows us to pull in additional fields in
      such cases.

      For example, the embedded repository object in a pull request does not normally
      contain its `owner`. To add that in we can use:
      `+values.destination.repository.owner`.


      ## Wildcards

      The asterisk can be used to match all fields on a particular level. For
      example, removing all entries from the `links` element can be done like this:

      ```json
      $ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/evzijst?fields=-links.*
      {
        "nickname": "evzijst",
        "account_status": "active",
        "website": "",
        "display_name": "Erik van Zijst",
        "uuid": "{a288a0ab-e13b-43f0-a689-c4ef0a249875}",
        "links": {},
        "created_on": "2010-07-07T05:16:36+00:00",
        "location": null,
        "type": "user"
      }
      ```

      Wildcards can be used in combination with exclusion and inclusion. For
      instance, `-*,+foo,+bar` will remove all elements from the root level and then
      add in `foo` and `bar`.


      ## URL encoding

      Be aware that when using the `+foo.bar` syntax in the query string, that the
      "+" must be URL encoded as "%2B" and so the URL will be:

      ```
      https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/interruptingcow?fields=%2Bowner.created_on
      ```

      Without URL escaping, "+" is interpreted as an encoded space which will not
      match any fields.


      ## Field discovery

      While a resource's `self` URL, as well its "collection" URL typically return
      the full object with all its fields, there are some exceptions for fields that
      are overly verbose or costly to generate.

      For instance, a pull request contains the embedded lists of reviewers and
      participants. These fields are included from the `self` URL, but not from the
      `/pullrequests` collections resource, as it would impact performance too much.

      To discover any additional fields that might not be included by default,
      `fields=*` can be used.


      ## More examples

      If we want to get a list of all reviewer nicknames on pull requests I created,
      we could combine a [filter](filtering) with a partial response. This will omit
      all other data from the response:

      ```
      /2.0/repositories/bitbucket/bitbucket/pullrequests?fields=values.id,values.reviewers.nickname,values.state&q=author.uuid%3D%22%7Bd301aafa-d676-4ee0-88be-962be7417567%7D%22
      {

              },
              {
                "nickname": "csomme"
              }
            ],

            ],
            "state": "OPEN",
            "id": 11344
          }
        ]
      }

      # Open API Specification and Object Representations

      * [JSON Schema](#jsonschema)
      * [Condensed Versus Full Objects](#representations)

      ____


      ## Open API Specification <a name="aoi"></a>

      Bitbucket uses the [Open API Specification](https://openapis.org) (OAI,
      formerly known as Swagger) to describe its APIs. Our OAI specification schema
      is hosted at [https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json](https://api.bitbucket.org/swagger.json)
      and serves as the canonical definition and comprehensive declaration of all
      available endpoints.

      The OAI specification makes writing client applications easier by:
      auto-generating boilerplate code (like data object classes) and dealing with
      authentication and error handling.

      You can find a comprehensive set of open tools for the OAI specification at:
      [https://github.com/swagger-api](https://github.com/swagger-api).


      ## JSON Schema <a name="jsonschema"></a>

      Bitbucket uses JSON Schema to describe the layout of every type of object
      consumed or produced by the API. These schemas are collected under the
      `#definitions` element of our swagger.json file.

      When an endpoint expects an object as part of a POST or PUT, it also expects
      the object to validate against the JSON schemas. The same applies to objects
      returned by an endpoint.


      ## Condensed Versus Full Objects <a name="representations"></a>

      Most objects in Bitbucket come both in "full" and "partial" representation.
      The full representation is when all elements are included. This is the layout
      returned by a resource's `self` location (e.g. `/2.0/repositories/foo/bar`),
      as well as resource collection endpoints (e.g. `/2.0/repositories`).

      However, Bitbucket objects often embed other objects. For example, a `repository`
      object embeds a `user` object for its owner. Likewise, a `pullrequest` object
      embeds its `repository` object.

      These related objects are embedded, or inlined, to reduce the "chatter" when
      clients make frequent followup API calls to collect information on common,
      related information.

      Embedded related objects are typically limited in their fields to avoid such
      object graphs from becoming too deep and noisy. They often exclude their own
      nested objects in an attempt to strike a balance between performance and
      utility.

      An object's embedded or condensed representation tends to be standardized,
      meaning the fields included is the same set, regardless of where the object
      was embedded.

      # URI, UUID, and structures

      You should be familiar with REST architecture before writing an integration. Read this overview page to gain a good understanding of Bitbucket's REST implementation.

      ----
      **On this page**

      * [URI structure](#uri-structure)
      * [HTTP methods](#http-methods)
      * [UUID](#uuid)
          * [User object and UUID](#userobj)
          * [Repository object and UUID](#repo-obj)
          * [Team object and UUID](#teamobj)
      * [Standard error responses](#stand-error)
      * [Standard ISO-8601 timestamps](#timestamp)

      ----


      ## URI structure <a name="uri-structure"></a>

      All Bitbucket Cloud requests start with the `https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0` prefix (for the 2.0 API) and `https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0` prefix (1.0 API).

      The next segment of the URI path depends on the endpoint of the request. For example, using the curl command and the repositories endpoint you can list all the issues on Bitbucket's tutorial repository:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org
      ```
      Given a specific endpoint, you can then drill down to a particular aspect or resource of that endpoint. The issues resource on a repository is an example:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/repositories/tutorials/tutorials.bitbucket.org/issues
      ```
      ### HTTP methods <a name="http-methods"></a>
      A given endpoint or resource has a series of actions (or methods) associated with it. The Bitbucket service supports these standard HTTP methods:

      <table class='aui'>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Call</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tr>
              <td>GET</td>
              <td>Retrieves information.  </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>PUT</td>
              <td>Updates existing information.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>POST</td>
              <td>Creates new information.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>DELETE</td>
              <td>Removes existing information.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      For example, you can call use the POST action on the issues resource and create an issue on the issue tracker.

      **Specifying content length**

      You can get a `411 Length Required` response. If this happens, the API requires a Content-Length header but the client is not sending it. You should add the header yourself, for example using the curl client:

      ```
      curl -r PUT --header "Content-Length: 0" -u user:pass https://api.bitbucket.org/1.0/emails/rap@atlassian.com
      ```
      ## Universally Unique Identifier <a name="uuid"></a>

      UUID's provide a single point of recognition for users, teams, and repositories. The UUID is distinct from the username, team name, and repository name fields and remains the same even when those fields change. For example when a user changes their username or moves a repository you will need to modify calls which use those identifiers but not if you are pointing to the UUID.

      ### UUID examples and structure

      UUID's work with both the 1.0 and 2.0 APIs for the user, team, and repository objects. The following examples the following characters are replacements for curly brackets: `%7B` replaces `{`  and `%7D` replaces `}`. You will see this structure in the following example sections.

      ### User object and UUID <a name="userobj"></a>

      When you make a call using either the username or the UUID for that user the response is the same.

      **Call with username**:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials
      ```

      ***Call with UUID for the user**:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/%7Bc788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007%7D
      ```

      **Response**
      ```JSON

      }
      ```

      ### Repository object and UUID <a name="repo-obj"></a>

      Once you have the UUID for a repository you no longer need a username or team name to make the API call so long as you use an empty field. This helps you resolve repositories no matter if the username or team name changes.

      **Call with team name (1team) and repository name (moxie)**:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/moxie
      ```
      **Call with UUID and empty field**:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/%7B%7D/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D
      ```

      **Call with UUID and teamname**:

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/1team/%7B21fa9bf8-b5b2-4891-97ed-d590bad0f871%7D
      ```

      ### Team object and UUID <a name="teamobj"></a>

      This example shows a call for a list of team members using both the team name and with the UUID for the team object. As the call is unauthenticated in the following example the response object will only show members with public profiles. The response is the same in either case.

      **Call with teamname**

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/1team/members
      ```
      **Call with UUID for team object**

      ```
      curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/teams/%7Baa559944-83c9-4963-a9a8-69ac8d9cf5d2%7D/members

      ## Standardized error responses <a name="stand-error"></a>

      The 2.0 API standardizes the error response layout. The 2.0 API serves a JSON
      object along with the appropriate HTTP status code. The JSON object provides a
      detailed  problem description.

      ```json
      {
          "type": "error",
          "error": {
              "message": "Bad request",
              "fields": {
                  "src": [
                      "This field is required."
                  ]
              },
              "detail": "You must specify a valid source branch when creating a pull request.",
              "id": "d23a1cc5178f7637f3d9bf2d13824258",
              "data": {
                "extra": "Optional, endpoint-specific data to further augment the error."
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      This object contains an error element which contains the following nested
      elements:

      <table class='aui'>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Element</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tr>
              <td>message</td>
              <td>A short description of the problem. This element is always present. Its value may be localized.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>fields</td>
              <td>This optional element is used in response to POST or PUT operations in which clients have provided invalid input. It contains a list of one or more client-provided fields that failed validation. The values may be localized.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>detail</td>
              <td>An optional detailed explanation of the failure. Its value may be localized.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
              <td>id</td>
              <td>An optional unique error identifier that identifies the error in Bitbucket's logging system. If you feel you hit a bug in an API and this field is provided, please mention it if you decide to contact support as it will greatly help us narrow down the problem.</td>
          </tr>
      </table>

      ## Standard ISO-8601 timestamps <a name="timestamp"></a>

      All 2.0 APIs use standardized ISO-8601 timestamps. In most cases, our APIs return UTC timestamps and for these, the timezone offset part will be 00:00. In rare cases where the original localized timestamp has significance, the timezone offset may identify the event's original timezone.

      # Cors and hypermedia

      This section describes [Cross-origin resource sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) (CORS), what content types we support in requests and responses, and hyperlinking resources in each json responses.


      ----
      **On this page**

      * [Supported content types](#supported-content)
      * [Resource links](#resource-links)

      ----

      ## Cors <a name="cors"></a>

      The Bitbucket API supports Cross-origin resource sharing to allow requests for restricted resources across domains. For more information you can refer to:

      * [Wikipedia article on CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)
      * [W3C CORS recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)

      Sending a general request from the api to bitbucket.com:

      `curl -i https://api.bitbucket.org -H "origin: http://bitbucket.com"`

      Gives this result:

          HTTP/1.1 302 FOUND

      Sending the same request with the CORS check -X OPTIONS in the call:

      ## Supported content types <a name="supported-content"></a>

      The default and primary content type for 2.0 APIs is JSON. This applies both to responses from the server and to the request bodies provided by the client.

      Unless documented otherwise, whenever creating a new (POST) or modifying an existing (PUT) object, your client must provide the object's normal representation. Not every object element can be mutated. For example, a repository's created_on date is an auto-generated, immutable field. Your client can omit immutable fields from a request body.

      In some cases, a resource might also accept regular application/x-www-url-form-encoded POST and PUT bodies. Such bodies can be more convenient in scripts and command line usage. Requests bodies can contain contain nested elements or they can be flat (without nested elements). Clients can send flat request bodies as either as application/json or as application/x-www-url-form-encoded. Nested objects always require JSON.

      ## Resource links <a name="resource-links"></a>

      Every 2.0 object contains a links element that points to related resources or alternate representations. Use links to quickly discover and traverse to related objects. Links serve a "self-documenting" function for each endpoint. For example, the following request for a specific user:


      `$ curl https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials`

      ```json
      {
          "username": "tutorials",
          "nickname": "tutorials",
          "account_status": "active",
          "website": "https://tutorials.bitbucket.org/",
          "display_name": "tutorials account",
          "uuid": "{c788b2da-b7a2-404c-9e26-d3f077557007}",
          "links": {
              "self": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials"
              },
              "repositories": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/tutorials"
              },
              "html": {
                  "href": "https://bitbucket.org/tutorials"
              },
              "followers": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/followers"
              },
              "avatar": {
                  "href": "https://bitbucket-assetroot.s3.amazonaws.com/c/photos/2013/Nov/25/tutorials-avatar-1563784409-6_avatar.png"
              },
              "following": {
                  "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/users/tutorials/following"
              }
          },
          "created_on": "2011-12-20T16:34:07.132459+00:00",
          "location": "Santa Monica, CA",
          "type": "user"
      }
      ```
      Links can be actual REST API resources or they can be informational. In this example, informative resources include the user's avatar and the HTML URL for the user's Bitbucket account. Your client should avoid hardcoding an API's URL and instead use the URLs returned in API responses.

      A link's key is its `rel` (relationship) attribute and it contains a mandatory href element. For example, the following link:

      ```json
      "self": {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials"
      }
      ```

      The rel for this link is self and the href is https://api.bitbucket.org/api/2.0/users/tutorials. A single rel key can contain an list (array) of href objects. Your client should anticipate that any rel key can contain one or more href objects.

      Finally, links can also contain optional elements. Two common optional elements are the name element and the title element. They are often used to disambiguate links that share the same rel key. In the example below, the repository object that contains a clone link with two href objects. Each object contains the optional name element to clarify its use.

      ```json
      "links": {
        "self": {
          "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/evzijst/bitbucket"
        },
        "clone": [
          {
            "href": "https://api.bitbucket.org/evzijst/bitbucket.git",
            "name": "https"
          },
          {
            "href": "ssh://git@bitbucket.org/erik/bitbucket.git",
            "name": "ssh"
          }
        ],
        ...
      }
      ```

      # Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket

      You can use the Atlassian Connect for Bitbucket Cloud to build add-ons which
      can connect with the Bitbucket UI and your own application set. An add-on could
      be an integration with another existing service, new features for the Atlassian
      application, or even a new product that runs within the Atlassian application.

      For complete information see:

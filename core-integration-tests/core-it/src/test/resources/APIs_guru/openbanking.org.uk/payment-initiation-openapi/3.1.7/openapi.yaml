                    WkInMnthDay - A monthly interval, specifying the week of the month (01 to 05) and day within the week (01 to 07)

                    IntrvlMnthDay - An interval specified in months (between 01 to 06, 12, 24), specifying the day within the month (-5 to -1, 1 to 31)

                    QtrDay - Quarterly (either ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, or RECEIVED). 

                    ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th December. 

                    SCOTTISH = Paid on the 2nd February, 15th May, 1st August and 11th November.

                    RECEIVED = Paid on the 20th March, 19th June, 24th September and 20th December.

                    ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th December.

        EvryWorkgDay - Every working day

        IntrvlWkDay - An interval specified in weeks (01 to 09), and the day within the week (01 to 07)

        WkInMnthDay - A monthly interval, specifying the week of the month (01 to 05) and day within the week (01 to 07)

        IntrvlMnthDay - An interval specified in months (between 01 to 06, 12, 24), specifying the day within the month (-5 to -1, 1 to 31)

        QtrDay - Quarterly (either ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, or RECEIVED)

        ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th December. 

        SCOTTISH = Paid on the 2nd February, 15th May, 1st August and 11th November.

        RECEIVED = Paid on the 20th March, 19th June, 24th September and 20th December.

        Individual Definitions:

        NotKnown - Not Known

        EvryDay - Every day

        EvryWorkgDay - Every working day

        IntrvlDay - An interval specified in number of calendar days (02 to 31)

        IntrvlWkDay - An interval specified in weeks (01 to 09), and the day within the week (01 to 07)

        WkInMnthDay - A monthly interval, specifying the week of the month (01 to 05) and day within the week (01 to 07)

        IntrvlMnthDay - An interval specified in months (between 01 to 06, 12, 24), specifying the day within the month (-05 to -01, 01 to 31)

        QtrDay - Quarterly (either ENGLISH, SCOTTISH, or RECEIVED)

        ENGLISH = Paid on the 25th March, 24th June, 29th September and 25th December.

        SCOTTISH = Paid on the 2nd February, 15th May, 1st August and 11th November.

        RECEIVED = Paid on the 20th March, 19th June, 24th September and 20th December.

        Individual Patterns:

        NotKnown (ScheduleCode)

        EvryDay (ScheduleCode)

        EvryWorkgDay (ScheduleCode)

        IntrvlDay:NoOfDay (ScheduleCode + NoOfDay)

        IntrvlWkDay:IntervalInWeeks:DayInWeek (ScheduleCode + IntervalInWeeks + DayInWeek)

        WkInMnthDay:WeekInMonth:DayInWeek (ScheduleCode + WeekInMonth + DayInWeek)

        IntrvlMnthDay:IntervalInMonths:DayInMonth (ScheduleCode + IntervalInMonths + DayInMonth)

        QtrDay: + either (ENGLISH, SCOTTISH or RECEIVED) ScheduleCode + QuarterDay

                      Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.


                      2. Tiered

                      Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.


                      3. Whole

                      The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the BCA balance

                            The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made.

                                    1. Banded

                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                    2. Tiered

                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                    3. Whole

                                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the product holder's account balance

                                          The annual equivalent rate (AER) is interest that is calculated under the assumption that any interest paid is combined with the original balance and the next interest payment will be based on the slightly higher account balance. Overall, this means that interest can be compounded several times in a year depending on the number of times that interest payments are made. 

                                          For SME Loan, this APR is the representative APR which includes any account fees.

                                    Interest rates are banded. i.e. Increasing rate on whole balance as balance increases.

                                    2. Tiered

                                    Interest rates are tiered. i.e. increasing rate for each tier as balance increases, but interest paid on tier fixed for that tier and not on whole balance.

                                    3. Whole

                                    The same interest rate is applied irrespective of the SME Loan balance

                                Market segmentation is a marketing term referring to the aggregating of prospective buyers into groups, or segments, that have common needs and respond similarly to a marketing action.

      description: >+
        Mastercard rePower empowers consumers to instantly add money to
        eligible Mastercard cards. Money is available immediately for
        expenditures anywhere Mastercard prepaid account is accepted. The ease
        with which cardholders can convert cash to prepaid card funds turns
        their reloadable prepaid cards into valuable and practical financial
        tools. Making the reload process simple and accessible provides
        merchants with an opportunity to increase cardholder traffic. Unlike
        other top-up services, merchants have the flexibility to set their own
        reload fees.  This resource streamlines development efforts to offer
        Mastercard rePower services, through quick and convenient web services
        with the following benefits: 1)Savings in development and operational
        costs associated with implementing a standard MIP
        connection.  2)Requires support for only a single acquiring
        interface.  3)Leverages existing processing messages and transaction
        codes  4)Mastercard provides a net settlement guarantee for each reload
        transaction  5)Supports EMV, PayPass & MDES transactions.  This resource
        facilitates the ability for cardholders to reload their prepaid cards
        easily and securely.

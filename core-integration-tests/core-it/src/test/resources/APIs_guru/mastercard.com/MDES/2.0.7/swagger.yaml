        Provides the ability to search for tokens based on Account PAN,

        Instance Id or Comment Id. Returns all of the tokens associated with an
        account according to the scope of the indicated search request criteria.
        The response includes key state and informational data for each token,
        including the Token Unique Reference which is needed for subsequent
        token lifecycle management activities.<br><br>_Notes:_ The Search API
        request MUST include only one of the available search methods Account
        PAN, Token Unique Reference, Token, Payment App Instance Id, Comment Id,
        or Alternate Account Identifier. They cannot be used together in a
        single request.<br> Moreover, this function only retrieves results if
        the search criteria matches a current value from the token vault. In
        other words, if the search criteria is a PAN that has been replaced, the
        system will not retrieve any data.

        Expiration Date Time period will begin, and a new Activation Code will

        pre-digitization network message. It can only be used to do this for

        Activation Code to the cardholder. For example, via email or SMS. It

        Application" activation method, for instance. A new Activation Code can
        be sent even if the previous code has not expired. A new Activation Code
        can also be sent even after the previous code has expired; however, it
        can only be done up to 30 days after the token was created  (the number
        of days is subject to change at the discretion of Mastercard).

    post:
      description: >
        Used to suspend an active token so that it may not initiate any new
        transactions. All authorizations for a SUSPENDED token will be declined.
        Tokens may be suspended by multiple parties (suspenders) concurrently.
        The token status is updated from ACTIVE to SUSPENDED when the first
        suspender triggers a suspend action. Additional suspenders can add their
        suspend action to the list of suspenders. Suspenders can unsuspend only
        their own suspend action. All suspenders need to perform an unsuspend
        action to move a token from SUSPENDED to ACTIVE. The token status will
        only change when the last suspender has unsuspended the token. <br>For
        CoF tokens, the only two supported suspenders are issuer and token
        requestor. <br>For Apple Pay tokens, there are some differences in
        behavior versus the general principles. An issuer may add themselves as
        a suspender to a token already suspended by a cardholder, as above.
        However, a cardholder cannot suspend a token already suspended by the
        issuer. As a special case for Apple Pay, an issuer may unsuspend
        (override) a token already suspended by a cardholder. However, a
        cardholder cannot unsuspend a token already suspended by the issuer.

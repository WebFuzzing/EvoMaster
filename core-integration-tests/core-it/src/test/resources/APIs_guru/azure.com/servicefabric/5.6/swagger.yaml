    description: |
      Allows filtering of the application health state objects returned in the result of cluster health
      query based on their health state.
      The possible values for this parameter include integer value obtained from members or bitwise operations
      on members of HealthStateFilter enumeration. Only applications that match the filter are returned.
      All applications are used to evaluate the aggregated health state. If not specified, all entries are returned.
      The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
      For example, if the provided value is 6 then health state of applications with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4) are returned.

      - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
      - None - Filter that doesnâ€™t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.

  ClusterHealthChunkQueryDescriptionOptionalBodyParam:
    description: |
      Describes the cluster and application health policies used to evaluate the cluster health and the filters to select which cluster entities to be returned.
      If the cluster health policy is present, it is used to evaluate the cluster events and the cluster nodes. If not present, the health evaluation uses the cluster health policy defined in the cluster manifest or the default cluster health policy.
      By default, each application is evaluated using its specific application health policy, defined in the application manifest, or the default health policy, if no policy is defined in manifest.
      If the application health policy map is specified, and it has an entry for an application, the specified application health policy
      is used to evaluate the application health.
      Users can specify very flexible filters to select which cluster entities to include in response. The selection can be done based on the entities health state and based on the hierarchy.
      The query can return multi-level children of the entities based on the specified filters. For example, it can return one application with a specified name, and for this application, return
      only services that are in Error or Warning, and all partitions and replicas for one of these services.

        Sends a health report on a Service Fabric cluster. The report must contain the information about the source of the health report and property on which it is reported.
        The report is sent to a Service Fabric gateway node, which forwards to the health store.
        The report may be accepted by the gateway, but rejected by the health store after extra validation.
        For example, the health store may reject the report because of an invalid parameter, like a stale sequence number.
        To see whether the report was applied in the health store, run GetClusterHealth and check that the report appears in the HealthEvents section.

      description: |
        The following is a list of APIs that start fault operations that may be cancelled using CancelOperation -
        - StartDataLoss
        - StartQuorumLoss
        - StartPartitionRestart
        - StartNodeTransition

        If force is false, then the specified user-induced operation will be gracefully stopped and cleaned up.  If force is true, the command will be aborted, and some internal state
        may be left behind.  Specifying force as true should be used with care.  Calling this API with force set to true is not allowed until this API has already
        been called on the same test command with force set to false first, or unless the test command already has an OperationState of OperationState.RollingBack.
        Clarification: OperationState.RollingBack means that the system will/is be cleaning up internal system state caused by executing the command.  It will not restore data if the
        test command was to cause data loss.  For example, if you call StartDataLoss then call this API, the system will only clean up internal state from running the command.
        It will not restore the target partition's data, if the command progressed far enough to cause data loss.

        Important note:  if this API is invoked with force==true, internal state may be left behind.

      Property:
        description: |
          The property of the health information. An entity can have health reports for different properties.
          The property is a string and not a fixed enumeration to allow the reporter flexibility to categorize the state condition that triggers the report.
          For example, a reporter with SourceId "LocalWatchdog" can monitor the state of the available disk on a node,
          so it can report "AvailableDisk" property on that node.
          The same reporter can monitor the node connectivity, so it can report a property "Connectivity" on the same node.
          In the health store, these reports are treated as separate health events for the specified node.

          Together with the SourceId, the property uniquely identifies the health information.

          Value that indicates whether the report is removed from health store when it expires.
          If set to true, the report is remopved from the health store after it expires.
          If set to false, the report is treated as an error when expired. The value of this property is false by default.
          When clients report periodically, they should set RemoveWhenExpired false (default).
          This way, is the reporter has issues (eg. deadlock) and can't report, the entity is evaluated at error when the health report expires.
          This flags the entity as being in Error health state.

      SequenceNumber:

          When clients report periodically, they should send reports with higher frequency than time to live.
          If clients report on transition, they can set the time to live to infinite.
          When time to live expires, the health event that contains the health information
          is either removed from health store, if RemoveWhenExpired is true, or evaluated at error, if RemoveWhenExpired false.

          If not specified, time to live defaults to infinite value.

    properties:
      HealthStateFilter:
        default: 0
        description: |
          The filter for the health state of the nodes. It allows selecting nodes if they match the desired health states.
          The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only nodes that match the filter are returned. All nodes are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.
          If not specified, default value is None, unless the node name is specified. If the filter has default value and node name is specified, the matching node is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches nodes with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesnâ€™t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
          - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.
          - All - Filter that matches input with any HealthState value. The value is 65535.

          If the node exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if the health state matches the other filter properties.
          If not specified, all nodes that match the parent filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health state filter.

        description: |
          The filter for the health state of the partitions. It allows selecting partitions if they match the desired health states.
          The possible values are integer value of one of the following health states. Only partitions that match the filter are returned. All partitions are used to evaluate the cluster aggregated health state.
          If not specified, default value is None, unless the partition id is specified. If the filter has default value and partition id is specified, the matching partition is returned.
          The state values are flag based enumeration, so the value could be a combination of these values obtained using bitwise 'OR' operator.
          For example, if the provided value is 6, it matches partitions with HealthState value of OK (2) and Warning (4).

          - Default - Default value. Matches any HealthState. The value is zero.
          - None - Filter that doesnâ€™t match any HealthState value. Used in order to return no results on a given collection of states. The value is 1.
          - Ok - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Ok. The value is 2.
          - Warning - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Warning. The value is 4.
          - Error - Filter that matches input with HealthState value Error. The value is 8.

          If the partition exists, it is included in the cluster health chunk if it respects the other filter properties.
          If not specified, all partitions that match the parent filters (if any) are taken into consideration and matched against the other filter members, like health state filter.

          The partition filter may specify multiple replica filters.
          For example, it can specify a filter to return all replicas with health state Error and another filter to always include a replica identified by its replica id.

      Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service where the service's Primary replicas should optimally be placed in a particular domain.

      This placement policy is usually used with fault domains in scenarios where the Service Fabric cluster is geographically distributed in order to indicate that a serviceï¿½s primary replica should be located in a particular fault domain, which in geo-distributed scenarios usually aligns with regional or datacenter boundaries. Note that since this is an optimization it is possible that the Primary replica may not end up located in this domain due to failures, capacity limits, or other constraints.

      Describes the policy to be used for placement of a Service Fabric service where two replicas from the same partition should never be placed in the same fault or upgrade domain.

      While this is not common it can expose the service to an increased risk of concurrent failures due to unplanned outages or other cases of subsequent/concurrent failures. As an example, consider a case where replicas are deployed across different data center, with one replica per location. In the event that one of the datacenters goes offline, normally the replica that was placed in that datacenter will be packed into one of the remaining datacenters. If this is not desirable then this policy should be set.

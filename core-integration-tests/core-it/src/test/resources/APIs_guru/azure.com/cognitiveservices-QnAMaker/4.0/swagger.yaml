To achieve this kind of protection, we’ve added rate limits (also known as throttling) to all endpoints. By enforcing a rate limit, we can restrict the frequency with which a bot can make a specific call. For example: with rate limiting enabled, if a bot wanted to post a large number of activities, it would have to space them out over a time period. Please note that the purpose of rate-limiting is not to cap the total volume for a bot. It is designed to prevent abuse of the conversational infrastructure that does not follow human conversation patterns.'

                  - answer: 'It is unlikely you’ll experience rate limiting, even at high volume. Most rate limiting would only occur due to bulk sending of activities (from a bot or from a client), extreme load testing, or a bug. When a request is throttled, an HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) response is returned along with a Retry-After header indicating the amount of time (in seconds) to wait before retrying the request would succeed. You can collect this information by enabling analytics for your bot via Azure Application Insights. Or, you can add code in your bot to log messages. '

        Use this endpoint to generate download URLs and related data for images you are authorized to download.

        Most product offerings have enforced periodic download limits such as monthly, weekly, and daily. When this operation executes, the count of allowed downloads is decremented by one for the product offering. Once the download limit is reached for a given product offering, no further downloads may be requested for that product offering until the next download period.

        The download limit for a given download period is covered in your product agreement established with Getty Images.

        You'll need an API key and a [Resource Owner Grant or Implicit Grant](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) access token to use this resource.

        ## Auto Downloads
        The `auto_download` request query parameter specifies whether to automatically download the image.

        If the `auto_download` request query parameter is set to _true_, the API will return an HTTP status code 303 *See Other*. Your client code will need to process this response and redirect to the URI specified in the *Location* header to enable you to automatically download the file. The redirection workflow follows the [HTTP 1.1 protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4.4).

        Client Request:

        ```
        https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/downloads/images/[asset_id]?auto_download=true
        ```

        Server Response:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
        Location: https://delivery.gettyimages.com/...
        ```

        If the `auto_download` request query parameter is set to false, the API will return a HTTP status code 200, along with the URI in the response body which can be used to download the image. 

        Client Request:

        ```
        https://api.gettyimages.com/v3/downloads/images/[asset_id]?auto_download=false
        ```

        Server Response:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        {
        	"uri": "https://delivery.gettyimages.com/..."
        }
        ```
        ## Downloading Via the Returned URI

        The URI returned by this call should be considered opaque and the format could change at any time.
        In order to get the filename, length or file type, the response headers must be inspected. An example
        response follows:

        ```
        content-length: 33959979
        content-type: image/jpeg
        content-disposition: attachment; filename=GettyImages-1167612765.jpg
        ```

        The `content-disposition` header must be parsed to get a usable filename.

        ## Download URI expiration

        Download URIs are _**only valid for 24 hours**_, starting from the moment they are returned from this call.

        Use this endpoint to generate download URLs and related data for videos you are authorized to download.

        Most product offerings have enforced periodic download limits such as monthly, weekly, and daily. When this operation executes, the count of allowed downloads is decremented by one for the product offering. Once the download limit is reached for a given product offering, no further downloads may be requested for that product offering until the next download period.

        The download limit for a given download period is covered in your product agreement established with Getty Images.

        You'll need an API key and a [Resource Owner Grant or Implicit Grant](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) access token to use this resource.

        ## Auto Downloads
        The `auto_download` request query parameter specifies whether to automatically download the video.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build 
        search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images":
            [
                "artist",
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a 
        detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images":
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist", 
                "artist_title", 
                "asset_family",
                "call_for_image",
                "caption", 
                "city",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",

                "country", 
                "credit_line", 
                "date_created", 
                "date_submitted",
                "download_sizes", 
                "editorial_segments",
                "event_ids",
                "graphical_style",
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "orientation",
                "product_types",
                "quality_rank",

                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution
        files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image 
        in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images":
            [
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Request Usage Considerations

        - Specifying the "entity_details" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build
        search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images":
            [
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a 
        detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images":
            [

                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {

        Use this endpoint to search Getty Images news, sports and entertainment events. Getty Images photographers and videographers cover editorially relevant events occurring around the world.  All images or video clips produced in association with an event, are assigned the same EventID. EventIDs are part of the meta-data returned in Search Results. Only content produced under a Getty Images brand name (Getty Images News, Getty Images Sports, Getty Images Entertainment, Film Magic, Wire Image) will be consistently assigned an EventID. The Event framework may also be used to group similar content, such as "Hats from the Royal Wedding" or "Odd-ballOffbeat images of the week".   

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.


        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.

        Use this endpoint to search over a blend of our contemporary stock photos, illustrations, archival images, editorial photos, illustrations and archival images. Because this draws from such a large diversity of content, the results will not be as relevant as when the more specific Creative or Editorial endpoints are used. Additionally, the response time for this endpoint is slower compared to that for Creative and Editorial-specific endpoints. For these reasons, it is highly recommended that those endpoints are used instead of this blended endpoint.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.

        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).

        To include your API token in the search request, add it to the headers as a Bearer token (example in curl):

        	-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of images. 
        The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist",
                "asset_family",
                "call_for_image",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "editorial_segments",
                "event_ids",
                "graphical_style",
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "orientation",
                "product_types",
                "quality_rank",
                "referral_destinations",
                "title"
            ]
        ]
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most 
        frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **display_set**
        in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Request Usage Considerations

        - Specifying the "entity_details" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.

        Use this endpoint to search our contemporary stock photos, illustrations and archival images.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.
         
        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to 
        build search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to 
        build a detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist",
                "asset_family",
                "call_for_image",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "editorial_segments",
                "event_ids",
                "graphical_style",
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "orientation",
                "product_types",
                "quality_rank",
                "referral_destinations",
                "title"
            ]
        ]
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution
        files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image 
        in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```Go
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

      summary: Search for creative images only
      tags:
        - Search
  /v3/search/images/creative/by-image:
    get:
      description: |
        Allows searching for similar creative images by passing the URL to an existing image. All responses will have the exclude_nudity filter automatically applied.

        Before calling the search by image endpoint, an image must be uploaded to a specific AWS S3 bucket. The bucket name is `search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com`.
        For example, using cURL:
        ```sh
        curl -i -X PUT https://search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com/my-test-image.jpg -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary "@testimage.jpg"
        ```

        Uploads can be overwritten if the names are the same, so using a prefix like the API Key, application name or company name is recommended. Uploads will expire from the bucket after 24 hours.

        Once the image has been uploaded, use the full URL in the `image_url` parameter, e.g. `image_url=https://search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com/my-test-image.jpg`.

        <!-- TODO/HACK from https://app.clickup.com/t/8mfmv3 - Uncomment this if image_fingerprint ever comes back to be useful -->
        <!-- Subsequent searches for the same image can be executed using the `image_fingerprint` that is returned by the initial search. -->

      description: |
        Use this endpoint to search our editorial stock photos, illustrations and archival images.  Editorial images represent newsworthy events or illustrate matters of general interest, such as news, sport and entertainment and are generally intended for editorial use.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.

        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.
        To include your API token in the search request, add it to the headers as a Bearer token (example in curl):

        	-H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>"

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of images. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist",
                "asset_family",
                "call_for_image",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "editorial_segments",
                "event_ids",
                "graphical_style",
                "license_model",
                "max_dimensions",
                "orientation",
                "product_types",
                "quality_rank",
                "referral_destinations",
                "title"
            ]
        ]
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every image in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "images": 
            [
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Request Usage Considerations

        - Specifying the "entity_details" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.

        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without
        being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only 
        assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.
        Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search
        response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "asset_family", 
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a 
        detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist",
                "asset_family", 
        		"call_for_image",
                "caption", 
                "clip_length",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name", 
                "color_type",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "era",
                "license_model",
                "mastered_to",
                "originally_shot_on",

                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files 
        that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result 
        set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos":
            [
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]

      summary: Search for creative videos

  /v3/search/videos/creative/by-image:
    get:
      description: |-
        Search for **similar creative videos** by passing an `asset_id` to an asset in our catalog OR `image_url` to any image or a frame grab from a video. All responses will have the exclude_nudity filter automatically applied.

        ## Searching by URL

        When searching by `image_url`, an image or frame grab in JPEG format must be uploaded to a specific AWS S3 bucket. The bucket name is `search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com`.
        Example using cURL:
        ```sh
        curl -i -X PUT https://search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com/my-test-image.jpg -H "Content-Type: image/jpeg" --data-binary "@testimage.jpg"
        ```

        Uploads will be overwritten if the names are the same, so using a prefix like the API Key, application name or company name is recommended. Uploads will expire from the bucket after 24 hours.

        Once the JPEG has been uploaded, use the full URL in the `image_url` parameter, e.g. `image_url=https://search-by-image.s3.amazonaws.com/my-test-image.jpg`.

        ## Searching by asset id

        When searching by `asset_id`, any image or video asset id in the Getty/iStock catalog can be used.

      description: |
        Use this endpoint to search current and archival video clips of celebrities, newsmakers, and events.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.

        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "asset_family", 
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "allowed_use",
                "artist",
                "asset_family", 
        		"call_for_image",
                "caption", 
                "clip_length",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_id",
                "collection_name", 
                "color_type",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "era",
                "event_ids",
                "license_model",
                "mastered_to",
                "originally_shot_on",
                "product_types",
                "quality_rank",
                "shot_speed",
                "source",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos":
            [
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Request Usage Considerations

        - Specifying the "entity_details" response field can have significant performance implications. The field should be used only when necessary.

        Use this endpoint to report the usages of a set of assets. The count of assets submitted in a single batch to this endpoint is limited to 1000. Note that all asset Ids specified must be valid or the operation will fail causing no usages to be recorded. In this case, you will need to remove the invalid asset Ids from the query request and re-submit the query.

        ##  Quickstart

        You'll need an API key and a [Resource Owner Grant](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) access token to use this resource.
        Please see our [Getting Started](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/getting-started.html) page for more information on how to sign up for an API key. 

        _Note_: Date of use can be in any unambiguous date format.

        Use this endpoint to return detailed video metadata for all the specified video ids.

        You'll need an API key and access token to use this resource.

        You can show different information in the response by specifying values on the "fields" parameter (see details below).
        You can search with only an API key, and that will give you search results that are equivalent to doing a search on the GettyImages.com site without being logged in (anonymous search).  If you are a Getty Images API customer and would like to ensure that your API searches return only assets that you have a license to use, you need to also include an authorization token in the header of your request.  Please consult our [Authorization FAQ](http://developers.gettyimages.com/en/authorization-faq.html) for more information on authorization tokens, and our [Authorization Workflows](https://github.com/gettyimages/gettyimages-api/blob/master/OAuth2Workflow.md) for code examples of getting a token.

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "asset_family",
                "caption",
                "collection_code",
                "collection_name",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ],
                "license_model",
                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Detail Fields Set

        The **detail_set** query string parameter fields value represents a large batch of metadata fields that are often used to build a detailed view of videos. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **detail_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos": 
            [
                "allowed_use",

                "color_type",
                "copyright",
                "date_created",
                "display_sizes":
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },

                "title"
            ]
        }
        ```

        #### Display Fields Set

        The **display_set** query string parameter fields value represents the fields that provide you with URLs for the low resolution files that are most frequently used to build a UI displaying search results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **display_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos":
            [
                "display_sizes": 
                [
                    {
                        "name": "comp"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "preview"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "thumb"
                    }
                ]
            ]
        }
        ```

        ## Request Usage Considerations

        ## Working with Fields Sets

        Fields sets are used in the **fields** request parameter to receive a suite of metadata fields. The following fields sets are available:

        #### Summary Fields Set

        The **summary_set** query string parameter fields value represents a small batch of metadata fields that are often used to build search response results. The following fields are provided for every video in your result set when you include **summary_set** in your request.

        ```
        {
            "videos":
            [

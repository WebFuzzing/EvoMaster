    The Account API provides endpoints for managing account-related entities on your platform. These related entities include account holders, accounts, bank accounts, shareholders, and KYC-related documents. The management operations include actions such as creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of them.

    For more information, refer to our [documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/platforms).
    ## Authentication
    To connect to the Account API, you must use basic authentication credentials of your web service user. If you don't have one, contact the [Adyen Support Team](https://support.adyen.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:

    ```
    curl
    -U "ws@MarketPlace.YourMarketPlace":"YourWsPassword" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    ...
    ```
    Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).

    ## Versioning
    The Account API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: "vXX", where XX is the version number.

    For example:
    ```
    https://cal-test.adyen.com/cal/services/Account/v4/createAccountHolder
    ```

        Updates the `accountHolderDetails` and `processingTier` of an account holder, and adds bank accounts and shareholders.

        When updating `accountHolderDetails`, parameters that are not included in the request are left unchanged except for the objects below.

        * `metadata`: Updating the metadata replaces the entire object. This means that to update an existing key-value pair, you must provide the changes along with other existing key-value pairs.

        When updating any field in the following objects, you must submit all the fields required for validation.

         * `address`

        * `fullPhoneNumber`

        * `bankAccountDetails.BankAccountDetail`

        * `businessDetails.shareholders.ShareholderContact`

         For example, to update the `address.postalCode`, you must also submit the `address.country`, `.city`, `.street`, `.postalCode`, and possibly `.stateOrProvince` so that the address can be validated.

        To add a bank account or shareholder, provide the bank account or shareholder details without a `bankAccountUUID` or a `shareholderCode`.

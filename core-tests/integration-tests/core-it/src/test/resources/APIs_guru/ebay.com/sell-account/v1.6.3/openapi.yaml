      description: "This method creates a new fulfillment policy where the policy encapsulates seller's terms for fulfilling item purchases. Fulfillment policies include the shipment options that the seller offers to buyers. Each policy targets a marketplaceId and categoryTypes.name combination and you can create multiple policies for each combination. Be aware that some marketplaces require a specific fulfillment policy for vehicle listings. A successful request returns the URI to the new policy in the Location response header and the ID for the new policy is returned in the response payload. Tip: For details on creating and using the business policies supported by the Account API, see eBay business policies. Marketplaces and locales Policy instructions can be localized by providing a locale in the Accept-Language HTTP request header. For example, the following setting displays field values from the request body in German: Accept-Language: de-DE. Target the specific locale of a marketplace that supports multiple locales using the Content-Language request header. For example, target the French locale of the Canadian marketplace by specifying the fr-CA locale for Content-Language.

With this method, a seller can discover if there are any action items in regards to providing more documentation and/or information about themselves, their company, or the bank account they are or will be using for seller payouts. These 'action items' are also know as 'Know Your Customer' (or KYC) checks. This method does not require any parameters other than the OAuth user token associated with the seller's account. If the managed payments seller does not currently have any pending 'KYC' action items, only a 204 No Content HTTP status code is returned, and no response payload. Note: This method is not applicable for sellers who are not eligible for eBay managed payments. For sellers who sell on one or more eBay marketplaces that currently support managed payments, they can check on their managed payments onboarding status by using the getPaymentsProgramOnboarding method."

Each policy targets a marketplaceId and categoryTypes.name combination and you can create multiple policies for each combination. Be aware that some marketplaces require a specific payment policy for vehicle listings. A successful request returns the URI to the new policy in the Location response header and the ID for the new policy is returned in the response payload.

If you call this method without specifying a country code, the call returns all the seller's shipping rate tables. The method's response includes a rateTableId for each table defined by the seller. Use a table's ID value in a fulfillment policy to specify the shipping rate table to use for that policy's DOMESTIC or INTERNATIONAL shipping option (make sure the locality of the rate table matches the optionType of the shipping option). This call currently supports getting rate tables related to the following marketplaces: EBAY_AU EBAY_CA EBAY_DE EBAY_ES EBAY_FR EBAY_GB EBAY_IT EBAY_US Note: Rate tables created with the Trading API might not have been assigned a rateTableId at the time of their creation. This method can assign and return rateTableId values for rate tables with missing IDs if you make a request using the country_code where the seller has defined rate tables. Sellers can define up to 40 shipping rate tables for their account, which lets them set up different rate tables for each of the marketplaces they sell into. Go to My eBay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences to create and maintain the rate tables. For more, see Using shipping rate tables. If you're using the Trading API, use the rate table ID values in the RateTableDetails container of the Add/Revise/Relist calls.

      description: "This method creates or updates a sales tax table entry for a jurisdiction. Specify the tax table entry you want to configure using the two path parameters: countryCode and jurisdictionId. A tax table entry for a jurisdiction is comprised of two fields: one for the jurisdiction's sales-tax rate and another that's a boolean value indicating whether or not shipping and handling are taxed in the jurisdiction. You can set up tax tables for countries that support different tax jurisdictions. Currently, only Canada, India, and the US support separate tax jurisdictions. If you sell into any of these countries, you can set up tax tables for any of the country's jurisdictions. Retrieve valid jurisdiction IDs using getSalesTaxJurisdictions in the Metadata API. For details on using this call, see Establishing sales-tax tables. Important! Starting in January 2019, eBay will begin to calculate, collect, and remit sales tax on behalf of sellers for items shipped to customers. This feature is rolling out on specific dates to specific US states as defined on the following page: eBay sales tax collection. Once eBay starts to collect sales tax for a state, no action is required on the seller's part and there will be no charges or fees for eBay automatically calculating, collecting and remitting sales tax. The sales-tax collection process will apply to all the sales in the states that support this feature, whether the seller is located in or outside of the United States. When a buyer purchases an item on eBay, and the ship-to address is one of the states where eBay collects the sales tax, eBay will calculate and add the applicable sales tax at checkout. The buyer will pay both the cost of the item along with the sales tax. eBay will collect and remit the tax."

Every eBay marketplace supports its own set of regions that you can use in the regionExcluded field. To determine the valid values for a marketplace, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingLocationDetails, then review the ShippingLocation fields in the response for the strings you use in regionExcluded.regionName fields. Configuring shipToLocations can be tricky because the regionIncluded and regionExcluded fields are valid in different parts of the schema, and their allowable settings vary upon the context. For details on configuring these fields, see The shipToLocations container.

Here, there's no reason to set regionExcluded fields. However, it makes sense to set the regionExcluded field when a seller wants to exclude a small area that's within a larger area they service. For example, suppose a seller indicates they ship 'Worldwide', but for some reason must exclude a specific country, or world region. Note: Configuring the shipToLocations is tricky because the regionIncluded and regionExcluded fields are valid in different parts of the schema and their allowable settings vary upon the context.

With this, there's no reason to set regionExclude fields. However, it makes sense to set the regionExcluded field when a seller wants to exclude a small area that's located within a larger area they service. For example, suppose a seller indicates they ship 'Worldwide', but for some reason must exclude a specific country, or world region, from the larger world area they ship to. To retrieve the regions you can specify in the associated regionName field, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ExcludeShippingLocationDetails, then review the Location fields in the response for the strings that you can specify regionExcluded.regionName. Note that if a buyer's primary ship-to location is a region that a seller has excluded in their fulfillment policy (or if the buyer does not have a primary ship-to location), they will receive an error message if they attempt to buy or place a bid on an item that uses that fulfillment policy.

Also, this field needs to be populated only when the associated shippingOptions container has optionType set to INTERNATIONAL. Withing an international shipping option, set this value to Worldwide to indicate the seller ships to all world regions. If needed, use the regionExcluded field to exclude any regions in the world to where the seller does not ship. Each eBay marketplace supports its own set of allowable shipping locations. Obtain the valid 'Ship-To Locations' for a marketplace by calling GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingLocationDetails, then review the ShippingLocation fields in the response for the strings that you can specify in the regionIncluded.regionName field. For DOMESTIC shipping options, eBay automatically uses the seller's listing country as the default regionIncluded country. For details on setting this field, see How to set up worldwide shipping.

Sellers can specify Extended Holiday Returns (as well as their regular non-holiday returns period) for chosen listings at any time during the year. The Extended Holiday Returns offer is not visible in listings until the start date of current year's holiday returns period, at which point it overrides the non-holiday returns policy. Buyers can see the Extended Holiday Returns offer in listings displayed through the purchase cutoff date and are able to return those purchases until the end date of the period. After the purchase cutoff date, the Extended Holiday Returns offer automatically disappears from the listings and the seller's non-holiday returns period reappears.

This fee is added to the total cost of the item, and the total cost is due from the buyer upon the delivery of the item. This field is applicable only if the buyer-selected payment method is 'COD' and the selected shipping service option supports a Cash on Delivery option. To see if a domestic shipping service supports the Cash on Delivery option, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingServiceDetails, then review the response to see if CODService is set to true for the targeted shipping service.
        freeShipping:

          description: "This object contains the regionIncluded and regionExcluded fields, which define the geographical regions that a seller does and does not cover by the associated shipping policy. shipToLocations appears at both the top-level of the fulfillment policy as well as here, within the shippingOptions.shippingServices container. Within individual shippingServices containers, use the regionIncluded container to specify the list of regions to where a seller ships using that particular shipping service (you can use different shipping services to cover different regions). Note: Do not populate the regionExcluded field at this level. Instead, define the regions to where a seller does not ship using the shipToLocations container found at the top level of the FulfillmentPolicyRequest container. Every eBay marketplace supports its own set of regions that you can use in the regionIncluded field. To determine the valid 'Ship-To' values for a marketplace, call GeteBayDetails with DetailName set to ShippingLocationDetails, then review the ShippingLocation fields in the response for the strings that you use in the regionIncluded.regionName field. When returned at this level, this container lists only the regionIncluded areas defined for the associated shippingService container. For more details, see The shipToLocations container."

          description: For FLAT_RATE shipping options, the amount specified in this field is the shipping cost for the selected shipping carrier and service. The amount supplied must exclude any additional shipping charges (such as the seller's handling charges). This field is not applicable in CALCULATED shipping services (the cost for a calculated shipping service cannot be determined until the listing has ended and the buyer has specified a postal code).

          description: "This integer value controls the order that this shipping service option appears in the View Item and Checkout pages, as related to the other specified shipping service options. Sellers can specify up to four domestic shipping services (in four separate shippingService containers), so valid values are 1, 2, 3, and 4. A shipping service option with a sortOrder value of '1' appears at the top of View Item and Checkout pages. Conversely, a shipping service option with a sortOrder value of '4' appears at the bottom of the list. Sellers can specify up to five international shipping services (in five separate shippingService containers, so valid values for international shipping services are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Similarly to domestic shipping service options, the sortOrder value of a international shipping service option controls the placement of that shipping service option in the View Item and Checkout pages. Set up different domestic and international services by configuring two shippingOptions containers, where you set shippingOptions.optionType to either DOMESTIC or INTERNATIONAL to indicate the area supported by the listed shipping services. If the sortOrder field is not supplied, the order of domestic and international shipping service options is determined by the order in which they are listed in the API call. Min: 1. Max: 4 (for domestic shipping service) or 5 (for international shipping service)."

  description: <p>The <i>Marketing API </i> offers two platforms that sellers can use to promote and advertise their products:</p> <ul><li><b>Promoted Listings</b> is an eBay ad service that lets sellers set up <i>ad campaigns </i> for the products they want to promote. eBay displays the ads in search results and in other marketing modules as <b>SPONSORED</b> listings. If an item in a Promoted Listings campaign sells, the seller is assessed a Promoted Listings fee, which is a seller-specified percentage applied to the sales price. For complete details, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promoted-listings.html">Promoted Listings</a>.</li>  <li><b>Promotions Manager</b> gives sellers a way to offer discounts on specific items as a way to attract buyers to their inventory. Sellers can set up discounts (such as "20% off" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion <i>teasers</i> throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see <a href="/api-docs/sell/static/marketing/promotions-manager.html">Promotions Manager</a>.</li></ul>  <p><b>Marketing reports</b>, on both the Promoted Listings and Promotions Manager platforms, give sellers information that shows the effectiveness of their marketing strategies. The data gives sellers the ability to review and fine tune their marketing efforts.</p> <p class="tablenote"><b>Important!</b> Sellers must have an active eBay Store subscription, and they must accept the <b>Terms and Conditions</b> before they can make requests to these APIs in the Production environment. There are also site-specific listings requirements and restrictions associated with these marketing tools, as listed in the "requirements and restrictions" sections for <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PL-requirements">Promoted Listings</a> and <a href="/api-docs/sell/marketing/static/overview.html#PM-requirements">Promotions Manager</a>.</p> <p>The table below lists all the Marketing API calls grouped by resource.</p>

      description: "This method creates a Promoted Listings ad campaign. A Promoted Listings campaign is the structure into which you place the ads for the listings you want to promote. Identify the items you want to place into a campaign either by &quot;key&quot; or by &quot;rule&quot; as follows: Rules-based campaigns &ndash; A rules-based campaign adds items to the campaign according to the criteria you specify in your call to createCampaign. Key-based campaigns &ndash; Add items to an existing campaign using either listing ID values or Inventory Reference values: Add listingId values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByListingID or bulkCreateAdsByListingId. Add inventoryReference values to an existing campaign by calling either createAdByInventoryReference or bulkCreateAdsByInventoryReference. Note: No matter how you add items to a Promoted Listings campaign, each campaign can contain ads for a maximum of 50,000 items. If a rules-based campaign identifies more than 50,000 items, ads are created for only the first 50,000 items identified by the specified criteria, and ads are not created for the remaining items. Creating a campaign To create a basic campaign, supply: The user-defined campaign name The start date (and optionally the end date) of the campaign The eBay marketplace on which the campaign is hosted Details on the campaign funding model The campaign funding model specifies how the Promoted Listings fee is calculated. Currently, the only supported funding model is COST_PER_SALE. For complete information on how the fee is calculated and when it applies, see Promoted Listings fees. If you populate the campaignCriterion object in your createCampaign request, campaign &quot;ads&quot; are created by &quot;rule&quot; for the listings that meet the criteria you specify, and these ads are associated with the newly created campaign. For details on creating Promoted Listings campaigns and how to select the items to be included in your campaigns, see Creating a Promoted Listings campaign. For recommendations on which listings are prime for a Promoted Listings ad campaign and to get guidance on how to set the bidPercentage field, see Using the Recommendation API to help configure campaigns. Tip: See Promoted Listings requirements and restrictions for the details on the marketplaces that support Promoted Listings via the API."

      description: "This method creates a report task, which generates a Promoted Listings report based on the values specified in the call. The report is generated based on the criteria you specify, including the report type, the report's dimensions and metrics, the report's start and end dates, the listings to include in the report, and more. Metrics are the quantitative measurements in the report while dimensions specify the attributes of the data included in the reports. When creating a report task, you can specify the items you want included in the report. The items you specify, using either listingId or inventoryReference values, must be in a Promoted Listings campaign for them to be included in the report. For details on the required and optional fields for each report type, see Creating Promoted Listings reports. This call returns the URL to the report task in the Location response header, and the URL includes the report-task ID. Reports often take time to generate and it's common for this call to return an HTTP status of 202, which indicates the report is being generated. Call getReportTasks (or getReportTask with the report-task ID) to determine the status of a Promoted Listings report. When a report is complete, eBay sets its status to SUCCESS and you can download it using the URL returned in the reportHref field of the getReportTask call. Report files are tab-separated value gzip files with a file extension of .tsv.gz. Note: This call fails if you don't submit all the required fields for the specified report type. Fields not supported by the specified report type are ignored. Call getReportMetadata to retrieve a list of the fields you need to configure for each Promoted Listings report type."

      description: "This method creates an item price markdown promotion (know simply as a &quot;markdown promotion&quot;) where a discount amount is applied directly to the items included the promotion. Discounts can be specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the items throughout the online sales flows. Unlike an item promotion, a markdown promotion does not require the buyer meet a &quot;threshold&quot; before the offer takes effect. With markdown promotions, all the buyer needs to do is purchase the item to receive the promotion benefit. Important: There are some restrictions for which listings are available for price markdown promotions. For details, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions. In addition, we recommend you list items at competitive prices before including them in your markdown promotions. For an extensive list of pricing recommendations, see the Growth tab in Seller Hub. There are two ways to add items to markdown promotions: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. New promotions must be created in either a DRAFT or a SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests (such as to schedule a promotion that's in a DRAFT state). Tip: Refer to Promotions Manager in the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage seller promotions. Markdown promotions are available on all eBay marketplaces. For more information, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions."

      description: "This method updates the specified item price markdown promotion with the new configuration that you supply in the payload of the request. Specify the promotion you want to update using the promotion_id path parameter. Call getPromotions to retrieve the IDs of a seller's promotions. When updating a promotion, supply all the fields that you used to configure the original promotion (and not just the fields you are updating). eBay replaces the specified promotion with the values you supply in the update request and if you don't pass a field that currently has a value, the update request fails. The parameters you are allowed to update with this request depend on the status of the promotion you're updating: DRAFT or SCHEDULED promotions: You can update any of the parameters in these promotions that have not yet started to run, including the discountRules. RUNNING promotions: You can change the endDate and the item's inventory but you cannot change the promotional discount or the promotion's start date. ENDED promotions: Nothing can be changed."

      description: "This method creates an item promotion, where the buyer receives a discount when they meet the buying criteria that's set for the promotion. Known here as &quot;threshold promotions&quot;, these promotions trigger when a threshold is met. eBay highlights promoted items by placing teasers for the promoted items throughout the online buyer flows. Discounts are specified as either a monetary amount or a percentage off the standard sales price of a listing, letting you offer deals such as &quot;Buy 1 Get 1&quot; and &quot;Buy $50, get 20% off&quot;. Volume pricing promotions increase the value of the discount as the buyer increases the quantity they purchase. Coded Coupons provide unique codes that a buyer can use during checkout to receive a discount. The seller can specify the number of times a buyer can use the coupon and the maximum amount across all purchases that can be discounted using the coupon. The coupon code can also be made public (appearing on the seller&rsquo;s Offer page, search pages, the item listing, and the checkout page) or private (only on the seller&rsquo;s Offer page, but the seller can include the code in email and social media). Note: Coded Coupons are currently available in the US, UK, DE, FR, IT, ES, and AU marketplaces. There are two ways to add items to a threshold promotion: Key-based promotions select items using either the listing IDs or inventory reference IDs of the items you want to promote. Note that if you use inventory reference IDs, you must specify both the inventoryReferenceId and the associated inventoryReferenceType of the item(s) you want to include the promotion. Rule-based promotions select items using a list of eBay category IDs or seller Store category IDs. Rules can further constrain items in a promotion by minimum and maximum prices, brands, and item conditions. You must create a new promotion in either a DRAFT or SCHEDULED state. Use the DRAFT state when you are initially creating a promotion and you want to be sure it's correctly configured before scheduling it to run. When you create a promotion, the promotion ID is returned in the Location response header. Use this ID to reference the promotion in subsequent requests. Tip: Refer to the Selling Integration Guide for details and examples showing how to create and manage threshold promotions using the Promotions Manager. For information on the eBay marketplaces that support item promotions, see Promotions Manager requirements and restrictions."

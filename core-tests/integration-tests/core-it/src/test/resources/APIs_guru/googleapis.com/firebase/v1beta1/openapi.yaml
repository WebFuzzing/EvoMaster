      description: Lists the valid Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource locations for the specified Project (including a FirebaseProject). One of these locations can be selected as the Project's [_default_ GCP resource location](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations), which is the geographical location where the Project's resources, such as Cloud Firestore, will be provisioned by default. However, if the default GCP resource location has already been set for the Project, then this setting cannot be changed. This call checks for any possible [location restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/defining-locations) for the specified Project and, thus, might return a subset of all possible GCP resource locations. To list all GCP resource locations (regardless of any restrictions), call the endpoint without specifying a unique project identifier (that is, `/v1beta1/{parent=projects/-}/listAvailableLocations`). To call `ListAvailableLocations` with a specified project, a member must be at minimum a Viewer of the Project. Calls without a specified project do not require any specific project permissions.

      description: Sets the default Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resource location for the specified FirebaseProject. This method creates an App Engine application with a [default Cloud Storage bucket](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/googlecloudstorageclient/setting-up-cloud-storage#activating_a_cloud_storage_bucket), located in the specified [`locationId`](#body.request_body.FIELDS.location_id). This location must be one of the available [GCP resource locations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/locations). After the default GCP resource location is finalized, or if it was already set, it cannot be changed. The default GCP resource location for the specified `FirebaseProject` might already be set because either the underlying GCP `Project` already has an App Engine application or `FinalizeDefaultLocation` was previously called with a specified `locationId`. Any new calls to `FinalizeDefaultLocation` with a *different* specified `locationId` will return a 409 error. The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations), which can be used to track the provisioning process. The [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) type of the `Operation` is google.protobuf.Empty. The `Operation` can be polled by its `name` using GetOperation until `done` is true. When `done` is true, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` has succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) will be set to a google.protobuf.Empty; if the `Operation` has failed, its `error` will be set to a google.rpc.Status. The `Operation` is automatically deleted after completion, so there is no need to call DeleteOperation. All fields listed in the [request body](#request-body) are required. To call `FinalizeDefaultLocation`, a member must be an Owner of the Project.

      description: "Links the specified FirebaseProject with an existing [Google Analytics account](http://www.google.com/analytics/). Using this call, you can either: - Specify an `analyticsAccountId` to provision a new Google Analytics property within the specified account and associate the new property with the `FirebaseProject`. - Specify an existing `analyticsPropertyId` to associate the property with the `FirebaseProject`. Note that when you call `AddGoogleAnalytics`: 1. The first check determines if any existing data streams in the Google Analytics property correspond to any existing Firebase Apps in the `FirebaseProject` (based on the `packageName` or `bundleId` associated with the data stream). Then, as applicable, the data streams and apps are linked. Note that this auto-linking only applies to `AndroidApps` and `IosApps`. 2. If no corresponding data streams are found for the Firebase Apps, new data streams are provisioned in the Google Analytics property for each of the Firebase Apps. Note that a new data stream is always provisioned for a Web App even if it was previously associated with a data stream in the Analytics property. Learn more about the hierarchy and structure of Google Analytics accounts in the [Analytics documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9303323). The result of this call is an [`Operation`](../../v1beta1/operations). Poll the `Operation` to track the provisioning process by calling GetOperation until [`done`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.done) is `true`. When `done` is `true`, the `Operation` has either succeeded or failed. If the `Operation` succeeded, its [`response`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.response) is set to an AnalyticsDetails; if the `Operation` failed, its [`error`](../../v1beta1/operations#Operation.FIELDS.error) is set to a google.rpc.Status. To call `AddGoogleAnalytics`, a project member must be an Owner for the existing `FirebaseProject` and have the [`Edit` permission](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495) for the Google Analytics account. If the `FirebaseProject` already has Google Analytics enabled, and you call `AddGoogleAnalytics` using an `analyticsPropertyId` that's different from the currently associated property, then the call will fail. Analytics may have already been enabled in the Firebase console or by specifying `timeZone` and `regionCode` in the call to [`AddFirebase`](../../v1beta1/projects/addFirebase)."

If `api_key_id` is not set in requests to [`androidApps.Create`](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.androidApps/create), then Firebase automatically associates an `api_key_id` with the `AndroidApp`. This auto-associated key may be an existing valid key or, if no valid key exists, a new one will be provisioned. In patch requests, `api_key_id` cannot be set to an empty value, and the new UID must have no restrictions or only have restrictions that are valid for the associated `AndroidApp`. We recommend using the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) to manage API keys.

If `api_key_id` is not set in requests to [`webApps.Create`](../../rest/v1beta1/projects.webApps/create), then Firebase automatically associates an `api_key_id` with the `WebApp`. This auto-associated key may be an existing valid key or, if no valid key exists, a new one will be provisioned. In patch requests, `api_key_id` cannot be set to an empty value, and the new UID must have no restrictions or only have restrictions that are valid for the associated `WebApp`.

To generate a `measurementId` and link the `WebApp` with a Google Analytics web stream, call [`AddGoogleAnalytics`](../../v1beta1/projects/addGoogleAnalytics).

      description: "Applies one or more updates to the presentation. Each request is validated before being applied. If any request is not valid, then the entire request will fail and nothing will be applied. Some requests have replies to give you some information about how they are applied. Other requests do not need to return information; these each return an empty reply. The order of replies matches that of the requests. For example, suppose you call batchUpdate with four updates, and only the third one returns information. The response would have two empty replies: the reply to the third request, and another empty reply, in that order. Because other users may be editing the presentation, the presentation might not exactly reflect your changes: your changes may be altered with respect to collaborator changes. If there are no collaborators, the presentation should reflect your changes. In any case, the updates in your request are guaranteed to be applied together atomically."

The offsets are measured in percentage from the corresponding edges of the object's original bounding rectangle towards inside, relative to the object's original dimensions. - If the offset is in the interval (0, 1), the corresponding edge of crop rectangle is positioned inside of the object's original bounding rectangle. - If the offset is negative or greater than 1, the corresponding edge of crop rectangle is positioned outside of the object's original bounding rectangle. - If the left edge of the crop rectangle is on the right side of its right edge, the object will be flipped horizontally. - If the top edge of the crop rectangle is below its bottom edge, the object will be flipped vertically. - If all offsets and rotation angle is 0, the object is not cropped. After cropping, the content in the crop rectangle will be stretched to fit its container.

Specifically, a `SLIDE_IMAGE` placeholder shape contains the slide thumbnail, and a `BODY` placeholder shape contains the speaker notes. - The notes master page properties define the common page properties inherited by all notes pages. - Any other shapes on the notes master appear on all notes pages.

          description: Output only. The revision ID of the presentation. Can be used in update requests to assert the presentation revision hasn't changed since the last read operation. Only populated if the user has edit access to the presentation. The revision ID is not a sequential number but a nebulous string. The format of the revision ID may change over time, so it should be treated opaquely. A returned revision ID is only guaranteed to be valid for 24 hours after it has been returned and cannot be shared across users. If the revision ID is unchanged between calls, then the presentation has not changed. Conversely, a changed ID (for the same presentation and user) usually means the presentation has been updated. However, a changed ID can also be due to internal factors such as ID format changes.

Otherwise, a 400 bad request error is returned. * If `weighted_font_family` is set and `font_family` is not, the font family and weight of `weighted_font_family` is applied. * If neither field is set, the font family and weight of the text inherit from the parent. Note that these properties cannot inherit separately from each other. If an update request specifies values for both `weighted_font_family` and `bold`, the `weighted_font_family` is applied first, then `bold`. If `weighted_font_family#weight` is not set, it defaults to `400`. If `weighted_font_family` is set, then `weighted_font_family#font_family` must also be set with a non-empty value.

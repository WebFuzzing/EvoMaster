/**
 * Test for a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
 * Those could be a Web Frontend in a Browser, or a Mobile app.
 * Usually, a test would be a series of interactions from the user with the GUI, likely clicking buttons.
 *
 * Each action is strongly dependent on all previous actions, as those define the current "view" of the GUI.
 * For example, a specific button could be clicked only if we are in the right page, accessed from following
 * a link in a previous action

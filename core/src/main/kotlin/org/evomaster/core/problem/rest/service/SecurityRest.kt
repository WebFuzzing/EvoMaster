    - from schema, check all DELETE operations
    - from archive, search if there is any test with a DELETE returning a 403
    - do that for every different endpoint. There are 2 options:
    -- (1) there is such call,  then
    ---     make a copy of the individual
    ----    do a "slice" and remove all calls after the DELETE call (if any)
    -- (2) there is not. need to create it based on successful create resources with authenticated user
    ---    search for create resource for endpoint of DELETE
    ---    do slice and remove calls after create resource endpoint call
    ---    add a DELETE with different user (verify get a 403)
    ---    make sure that DELETE is bound on some resource path as the create operation
    - append new REST Call action (see mutator classes) for PATCH/PUT with different auth, based
      on action copies from action definitions. should be on same endpoint.
    - need to resolve path element parameters to point to same resolved endpoint as DELETE
    - as PUT/PATCH requires payloads and possible valid query parameters, search from archive an
      existing action that returns 2xx, and copy it to use as starting point
    - execute new test case with fitness function
    - create new testing targets based on status code of new actions
    - add to archive (if needed)

/**
 *
 * A building block representing one part of an Individual.
 * The terms "gene" comes from the evolutionary algorithm literature
 *
 * When creating a new Gene type, should not extend directly from this class, but rather
 * from [SimpleGene], [CompositeGene] or [CompositeFixedGene], or any of their subclasses.
 * There are test cases to impose this property.
 *
 *
 * TO enable adaptive hypermutation
 * 1. override [mutationWeight] if the gene is not simple gene, e.g., it is complex with many genes inside
 *
 * 2. if the gene has inner genes, then we need to collect impact info.
 * Implement an impact (a subclass of [GeneImpact]) for the new gene to collect impact info for gene mutation.
 * Impact here is referred to how the gene is influencing the fitness.
 * For instance, see [org.evomaster.core.search.impact.impactinfocollection.value.ObjectGeneImpact]
 *  we collect impacts for each field, then could guide on which field to be selected for mutation.
 * See more details in comments of [org.evomaster.core.search.impact.impactinfocollection.GeneImpact]
 *
 * 3. override [mutablePhenotypeChildren] to decide 1) whether to apply selection for the internal genes
 *  2) what candidates are in [this] gene to be selected for mutation, eg, mutable fields for ObjectGene.
 *      More info could be found with comments of the method.
 *
 * 4. with the collected impact info, override [adaptiveSelectSubsetToMutate] to decide which gene to be selected
 *

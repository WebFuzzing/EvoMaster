/**
 * An implementation of the Standard Genetic Algorithm (Standard GA).
 *
 * This algorithm evolves a population of individuals using tournament selection,
 * crossover, and mutation, guided by fitness. It is one of the core metaheuristics
 * supported in EvoMaster.
 *
 * Each iteration (via [searchOnce]) forms a new population by:
 * 1. Selecting parent individuals using tournament selection,
 * 2. Optionally applying crossover with a probability defined by [config.xoverProbability],
 * 3. Optionally applying mutation to each offspring with a probability defined by [config.fixedRateMutation],
 * 4. Adding the offspring to the next generation.
 *
 * The process continues until the configured population size is reached or the time budget ends.
 *
 * Note:
 * - This implementation assumes that crossover and mutation are implemented by the superclass.
 * - The actual fitness evaluation is managed externally via the [WtsEvalIndividual] wrapper.

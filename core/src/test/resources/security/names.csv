uri,Specifies Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the integration endpoint. For HTTP or <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> integrations the URI must be a fully formed encoded HTTP(S) URL according to the RFC-3986 specification for either standard integration where <code>connectionType</code> is not <code>VPC_LINK</code> or private integration where <code>connectionType</code> is <code>VPC_LINK</code>. For a private HTTP integration the URI is not used for routing. For <code>AWS</code> or <code>AWS_PROXY</code> integrations the URI is of the form <code>arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:path|action/{service_api</code>}. Here {Region} is the API Gateway region (e.g. us-east-1); {service} is the name of the integrated Amazon Web Services service (e.g. s3); and {subdomain} is a designated subdomain supported by certain Amazon Web Services service for fast host-name lookup. action can be used for an Amazon Web Services service action-based API using an Action={name}&amp;{p1}={v1}&amp;p2={v2}... query string. The ensuing {service_api} refers to a supported action {name} plus any required input parameters. Alternatively path can be used for an Amazon Web Services service path-based API. The ensuing service_api refers to the path to an Amazon Web Services service resource including the region of the integrated Amazon Web Services service if applicable. For example for integration with the S3 API of <code>GetObject</code> the <code>uri</code> can be either <code>arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:action/GetObject&amp;Bucket={bucket}&amp;Key={key}</code> or <code>arn:aws:apigateway:us-west-2:s3:path/{bucket}/{key}</code>.,1

/*
    When running for the first time against unversioned database containing data,
    the first migration V001__base_version.sql will be skipped and this one will
    be executed. Before this script executed, schema_version will contain single
    autogenerated record for the initial state of database and after there will
    be two records. When running against empty database all migrations will be
    executed.

    This migration does nothing and intended for initial debugging of baselining
    empty and non empty databases.

    For more information on process see http://flywaydb.org/documentation/

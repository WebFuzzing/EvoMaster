EvoMaster ([www.evomaster.org](http://evomaster.org)) is a tool prototype 
that automatically *generates* system-level test cases.
Internally, it uses an *evolutionary algorithm* and *bytecode analysis* to be
able to generate effective test cases.
The approach is to *evolve* test cases from an initial population of 
random ones, trying to maximize measures like code coverage and fault detection.

At the moment, EvoMaster targets RESTful APIs compiled to 
JVM 8 bytecode (e.g., Java and Kotlin).

This project is in early stage of development. Documentation is still under construction.
A short [video](https://youtu.be/7zTLUlH-BNI) shows the use of EvoMaster on one of the 
case studies in [EMB](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB). 


EvoMaster is currently (2018-2021) funded by a 7.8 million Norwegian Kroner grant 
by the Research Council of Norway (RCN), as part of the 
Frinatek project <i>Evolutionary Enterprise Testing</i>.  

To compile the project, use the Maven command:

`mvn  clean install -DskipTests`

This should create an `evomaster.jar` executable under the `core/target` folder.

Note: if you get an arror from the shade-plugin, then make sure to use
`clean` in your maven commands.

### Example

The following code is an example of one test that was automatically
generated by EvoMaster for a REST service called 
"scout-api" (see [EMB](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB)).
The generated test uses the [RestAssured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) library.

```
@Test
public void test12() throws Exception {
        
    String location_activities = "";
        
    String id_0 = given().accept("*/*")
            .header("Authorization", "ApiKey administrator") // administrator
            .contentType("application/json")
            .body("{\"name\":\"JIg\", \"date_updated\":\"1968-7-28T10:40:58.000Z\", \"description_material\":\"CDasIs\", \"description_prepare\":\"VatRg\", \"description_main\":\"vbhUS\", \"description_safety\":\"mdMZXtHaW6Ac0L7\", \"age_min\":-1639552914, \"age_max\":-546, \"participants_min\":-166, \"time_max\":-728, \"featured\":true, \"activity\":{\"ratings_sum\":-2169794882535544017, \"favourites_count\":2018287764382358555, \"ratings_average\":0.7005221066369205, \"related\":[5230990194698818394, 4025421724722458028, -1291838056, -210322044]}}")
            .post(baseUrlOfSut + "/api/v1/activities")
            .then()
            .statusCode(200)
            .extract().body().path("id").toString();
                
    location_activities = "/api/v1/activities/" + id_0;
        
    given().accept("*/*")
            .header("Authorization", "ApiKey administrator") // administrator
            .contentType("application/json")
            .body("{\"rating\":7126434, \"favourite\":false}")
            .post(resolveLocation(location_activities, baseUrlOfSut + "/api/v1/activities/-324163273/rating"))
            .then()
            .statusCode(204);
        
    given().accept("*/*")
            .header("Authorization", "ApiKey administrator") // administrator
            .delete(resolveLocation(location_activities, baseUrlOfSut + "/api/v1/activities/-324163273/rating"))
            .then()
            .statusCode(204);
}
```

The generated tests are self-contained, i.e. they 
start/stop the REST server by themselves:

```
    private static SutHandler controller = new em.embedded.se.devscout.scoutapi.EmbeddedEvoMasterController();
    private static String baseUrlOfSut;
    
    
    @BeforeClass
    public static void initClass() {
        baseUrlOfSut = controller.startSut();
        assertNotNull(baseUrlOfSut);
        RestAssured.urlEncodingEnabled = false;
    }
    
    
    @AfterClass
    public static void tearDown() {
        controller.stopSut();
    }
    
    
    @Before
    public void initTest() {
        controller.resetStateOfSUT();
    }
```

### EvoMaster Core

Once the file `evomaster.jar` has been packaged, or
the latest release has been downloaded from the 
[releases page](https://github.com/EMResearch/EvoMaster/releases),
it can be executed directly from a commandline/shell.
 
Available options can be queried by using:

`java -jar evomaster.jar --help`

The most important options are:

* `--maxTimeInSeconds <Int>`        
Maximum number of seconds allowed for the search. 
**The more time is allowed, the better results one can expect**.
But then of course the test generation will take longer.

* `--outputFolder <String>`   
The path directory of where the generated test classes 
should be saved to.
 
* `--outputFormat <OutputFormat>`            
Specify in which format the tests should be outputted.
For example, JAVA_JUNIT_5 or JAVA_JUNIT_4.
Use `--help` to check what currently supported.

* `--testSuiteFileName <String>`             
The name of generated file with the test cases, 
without file type   extension. 
In JVM languages, if the name contains `.`, 
folders will be created to represent the given
package structure.


### EvoMaster Driver
    
Note, to generate tests, you need an EvoMaster Driver up and running before 
executing `evomaster.jar`.
These drivers have to be built manually for each system under test (SUT).
See [EMB](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB) for a set of existing SUTs with drivers.

To build a client driver in Java (or any JVM language), you need to import the
EvoMaster Java client library. For example, in Maven:

```
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.evomaster</groupId>
   <artifactId>evomaster-client-java-controller</artifactId>
   <version>LATEST</version>
</dependency>
```

For the latest version, check [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.evomaster/evomaster-client-java-controller).
The latest version number should also appear at the top of this page.
If you are compiling directly from the EvoMaster source code, make sure to use `mvn install` to 
install the snapshot version of the Java client into your local Maven repository 
(e.g., under *~/.m2*). 

Once the client library is imported, you need to create a class that extends either
`org.evomaster.clientJava.controller.EmbeddedSutController`
 or
 `org.evomaster.clientJava.controller.ExternalSutController`.
Both these classes extend `SutController`.
The difference is on whether the SUT is started in the same JVM of the EvoMaster
driver (*embedded*), or in a separated JVM (*external*).
 
The easiest approach is to use the *embedded* version, especially when dealing with
frameworks like Spring and DropWizard. 
However, when the presence of the EvoMaster client library gives side-effects (although 
its third-party libraries are shaded, side-effects might still happen),
or when it is not possible (or too complicate) to start the SUT directly (e.g., JEE),
it is better to use the *external* version.
The requirement is that there should be a single, self-executable uber/fat jar for the SUT 
(e.g., Wildfly Swarm).
It can be possible to handle WAR files (e.g., by using Payara), 
but currently we have not tried it out yet.

Once a class is written that extends either `EmbeddedSutController` or
`ExternalSutController`, there are a few abstract methods that need to
be implemented.
For example, those methods specify how to start the SUT, how it should be stopped,
and how to reset its state.
The EvoMaster Java client library also provides further utility classes to help
writing those controllers/drivers.
For example, `org.evomaster.clientJava.controller.db.DbCleaner` helps in resetting
the state of a database (if any is used by the SUT).

Until better documentation and tutorials are provided,
to implement a `SutController` class check the JavaDocs of the extended super class,
and the existing examples in 
[EMB](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB).


Once a class `X` that is a descendant of `SutController` is written, you need
to be able to start the EvoMaster driver, by using the 
`org.evomaster.clientJava.controller.InstrumentedSutStarter`
class. 
For example, in the source code of the class `X`, you could add:
 
```
public static void main(String[] args){

   SutController controller = new X();
   InstrumentedSutStarter starter = new InstrumentedSutStarter(controller);

   starter.start();
}
```

At this point, once this driver is started (e.g., by right-clicking on it in
an IDE to run it as a Java process),
then you can use `evomaster.jar` to finally generate test cases.


### How to Contribute

There are many ways in which you can contribute.
If you found EvoMaster of any use, the easiest
way to show appreciation is to *star* it.
Issues and feature requests can be reported on
the [issues](https://github.com/EMResearch/EvoMaster/issues) page:  
  
* *Bugs*: as for any bug report, the more detailed
  you can be the better.
  If you are using EvoMaster on an open source project,
  please provide links to it, as then it is much easier
  to reproduce the bugs.
  
* If you are trying to use EvoMaster, but the instructions
  in these notes are not enough to get you started, 
  then it means it is a "bug" in the documentation, which then would need
  to be clarified. 
  
* *Feature Requests*: to improve EvoMaster,
  we are very keen to receive
  feature requests, although of course we cannot
  guarantee when they are going to be implemented. 
    

### Publications and Further Resources

The development of EvoMaster is rooted in academia.
Academic publications based on EvoMaster and slides of presentations can be 
found [here](docs/publications.md).
These can be useful if you want to know more on how EvoMaster works internally,
e.g., details on the Many Independent Algorithm (MIO).

# How to Contribute

There are many ways in which you can contribute.
If you found _EvoMaster_ of any use, _the easiest
way to show appreciation is to **star** it_.
Issues and feature requests can be reported on
the [issues](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EvoMaster/issues) page:  
  
* *Bugs*: as for any bug report, the more detailed
  you can be the better.
  If you are using _EvoMaster_ on an open source project,
  please provide links to it, as then it is much easier
  to reproduce the bugs.
  
* *Documentation*: if you are trying to use _EvoMaster_, but the instructions
  in these notes are not enough to get you started, 
  then it means it is a "bug" in the documentation, which then would need
  to be clarified. 
  
* *Feature Requests*: to improve _EvoMaster_,
  we are very keen to receive feature requests, although of course we cannot
  guarantee when they are going to be implemented, if implemented at all. 
  As researchers, we want to know what are the problems that engineers in industry
  do face, and what could be done to improve _EvoMaster_ to help them.
  
  
* *Pull Requests*: we are keen to receive PRs, as long as you agree
  with the license of _EvoMaster_, and as long as you are allowed by your employer to contribute
  to open-source projects. However, before making a PR, you should read
  the [notes for developers](for_developers.md).  


* *Industry Collaborations*: to evaluate the effectiveness of _EvoMaster_, we need case studies.
  There are some open-source projects that can be used (e.g., which we selected and aggregated in the
  [EMB repository](https://github.com/WebFuzzing/EMB)).
  But open-source applications are not necessarily representative of software developed in industry.
  Therefore, we "collaborate" with different companies (e.g., currently Volkswagen and Meituan),
  to apply _EvoMaster_ on their systems.
      
  * *Benefits for us*: access to the source code of real, industrial systems (of course, under NDAs). 
    It makes easier to publish academic papers, and to get funding from the research councils
    to improve _EvoMaster_ even further.  
  * *Benefits for the industrial collaborators*: 
    
    1. getting priority on new features and bug fixing.
    2. "free" human resources (MSc/PhD students and researchers) that try to break your systems and
        find faults in them.
    
  If this can be of interest for you, drop us a message.  
    
* *Academic Collaborations*: we are keen to hear from students and researchers that want to 
  collaborate on topics in which _EvoMaster_ can be used on, or extended for.
  For example, it is possible to have visiting PhD students in our lab in Oslo, Norway.
  However, all communications about academic collaborations should not be done here on GitHub,
  but rather by email, directly to Prof. A. Arcuri. 
  Note that in Norway we are no longer allowed to have visitors or new employees from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia. 
  This is political, and has nothing to do with this project. 
  It is out of our control. 
  If you are a citizen of China or Iran, and would like to be an academic visitor collaborating on EvoMaster, we have academic collaborators in China and Argentina that might accept visitors.

### Unfortunately, had to disable this. Originally added to be able to run CI from PRs from forks (eg from external people).
### But this leads to run CI 2 twice on each push on an open PR, regardless of fork.
### It seems there is no solution for this:

  # Unfortunately, to use JPackage we need JDK 17 or above :(

  # third-party libraries, which might do it only in special cases.

# This build is quite expensive (some hours), so we run it whole only on some JVM versions and OSs.
# For the moment, we need to support JVM 8 and all following LTS versions (e.g, 11 and  17).
# EM should run an all OSs. As our main development machines are Windows and Mac, just
# testing whole build with all E2E only on Linux should be fine.

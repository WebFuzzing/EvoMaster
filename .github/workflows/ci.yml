  # Unfortunately, to use JPackage we need JDK 17 or above :(
  # Which is really bad due to the madness of --add-opens.
  # Even if hunt down all cases of reflections in EM, there is still the problem of
  # third-party libraries, which might do it only in special cases.
  # For some "hilarious" case, see:

# This build is quite expensive (1ish hour), so we run it whole only on 1 JVM version, and 1 OS.
# Recall that we also build on CircleCI, with different configurations.
# For the moment, we need to support JVM 8 and 11, with 17 when it comes out.
# EM should run an all OSs. As our main development machines are Windows and Mac, just
# testing whole build with all E2E only on Linux should be fine.

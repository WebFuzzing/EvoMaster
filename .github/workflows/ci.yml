# This build is quite expensive (1ish hour), so we run it only on 1 JVM version, and 1 OS.
# Recall that we also build on CircleCI, with different configurations.
# For the moment, we need to support JVM 8 and 11, with 17 when it comes out.
# EM should run an all OSs. As our main development machines are Windows and Mac, just
# testing on Linux should be fine.
